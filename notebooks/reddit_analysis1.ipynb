       "'as I am lying in the dark trying to fall asleep in the midst of a depressive episode, a question comes to me:\\nis it worse to feel nothing or to feel everything?\\nwhen i feel numb i get frustrated that i know what i want to feel, but i can not let the emotions out.\\nbut being overwhelmed with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, disappointment..(the list goes on), is torturous in itself.\\n\\nidk if anyone relates to this, I have been on reddit for a while and never posted but seeing people who i relate to has given me some validation when the people around me do not understand.  i hope i can do the same for others :)i can not write like i used to. my work engagement online took a sharp drop and is still falling. the only people engaging are the friends i made when i was in a better place, and sometimes not even them. i miss making stories that could move people. i loved seeing them cry and rejoice in my comment section. now the only comment is an occasional \"keep up the good work op,\" and sometimes not even that.And the worst part is, they are all alive. I have been outcasted by each and every one of them. I formed such strong bonds that if you asked me if I saw this coming back then I never would have guessed it. My little cousin is not allowed to text me anymore, and that was the last straw. \\n\\nI am so used to the loss that when I found out the last person I have a bond with left me today I did not even flinch. I am so used to losing everything over and over and over. I am stuck between wanting to purge them all or killing myself. I am not even shedding tears anymore. \\n\\nI do not....\\n\\nI do not know what to say anymore..\\n\\nI am just going to lay here..until..I do not know anymore. \\n\\nI do not know...I just want to know how does it feel to attempt suicide. Does it make the shitty brain and emotions better? Does it help someway? Is the ratio between pain of suicide and pleasure of getting over worth it? And what happens socially when we fail the attempt?I am numb today. Pushing my partner away with vile snaps but also simultaneously needing his love and comfort the most. \\n\\nFor the first time today my suicidal thoughts brought me to how I would do it. Sleeping pills. Nothing in my life seems worth the effort anymore. I feel like when I have the “energy” to do things it is nothing but a front. \\n\\nI have been in therapy for years, I am on antidepressants. There is nothing left to help me and I am mother fucking tired. \\n\\nTired and done. \\n\\nAnyone else or just me?I know that this is such a generic problem and I should just suck it up, but I can not. The only thing that kept me going for so long was my identity as a nerd. I know this probably sounds weird but I am literally good at nothing but school. it is the one thing in my life where I can actually feel good about myself, but that all just changed. A few weeks ago, I got waitlisted/rejected from the colleges that I wanted to go to, and ever since then I could not stop thinking about killing myself. I try to stay positive by thinking that I could transfer another year but that mindset only helps for a few minutes at a time. I seriously wanted to kill myself before all this happened and the hope for getting into a good college helped put a hold on that, but now I do not have that hope anymore. My friends all got accepted intot the colleges they wanted to go to and I am just stuck here in quarantine wanting to kill myself. I do not know how much longer I can handle all of these losses I have been taking-literally nothing I do is good enough (all my friends have boyfriends or girlfriends but whenever I like someone, I just get rejected)(see the trend?). All in all, I gues this rant is just a last ditch attempt to find any motivation to keep going and not end it here. (I am also sorry if my problems that I talked about seem minuscule and stupid.)I (20 M) am in college and I just want to know if how I am feeling is normal. what are some signs of depression? I am afraid to ask my mother because I do not want her to worry about me like that.I do not know if I belong on this subreddit or not, but I want to talk to someone about my thoughts going on in my head right now. I play drums and that helps me forget about things but when I go to sleep the thoughts hit me. I am rubbish at it. No one cares about it. I am such a pussy. No, stop thinking about this, you are just doing it for attention. My dad I think has moulded my personality when comforting people into “they are faking it and doing it for attention” and I feel like that about myself all the time. I am bullied at school mostly by this one kid who is the most egotistical asshole I have ever met, he is the type of kid to take a picture of his shitty abs and post it on WhatsApp or instagram or whatever and I am starting to succumb to what he says about me. you are a bitch. Shut up no one cares about your opinion. Fuck you I hate you.\\n\\nI keep a little note on my phone for when the late at night thoughts creep up on me at it is filled up. Not only with all this but the Coronavirus lockdown is making it even worse. I sometimes stare up at my light in my room (when the thoughts are at my worst) and wonder if it can support my weight. I have to lovely parents that care deeply about me and they are really the only ones keeping me from just ending it all. Sorry If I sound dramatic. I just want adviceMy way of thinking is pretty simple but my mental illness is making me complicated. I do not feel like I am the same person. Because I often am pretty simple but during a depressed episode it changes completely but also out of it it can get worse. I can not take jokes correctly (My humor is usually pretty dark.) Right now I do not see myself as a person. it is so paradoxical. I usually am a pretty positive person. But my mental illness is turning me to the polar opposite. Also because of the quarantine I have no access to any sort of therapy. Which makes it even worse.\\nI would really appreciate being simple but that does not seem to work out.I have experienced a breakup like 2-3 days ago and it was really painful since she was really important person in my life and helped me with my depression and self confidence a lot. I feel like  shit again and my heart feels like it is burning constantly, I can not sleep anymore and cry maybe 2 hours out of the 10 that I am awake so I do not know what to do to feel better or even forget her, maybe someone here can help me I would be very thankful.I fucking hate this absolute fucking bullshit, it is not fair that I am being forced to live like this. Why could not I have just been okay? Why could not I have just gotten on with it and never suffered? I fucking despise waking up every fucking morning, thinking ‘not this fuckery again’, I hate trying so hard to feel something other than hollow and ending up with heaviness in my chest and a headache, I hate fucking pretending because I feel too guilty to be openly depressed. For fucks sake, I feel like every fucking day is the same - all I do is sleep, wake up, eat, lie in bed and sleep. I have no concept of time anymore and I hate it, I need time back, I need my life back. \\n\\nI lost the best years of my life to a fucking chemical imbalance. it is not! fucking! fair! and it will not go away, and I am trying so fucking hard to manage it but it will not work, I can not do itI feel like i have tried everything, but nothing works just day after say the same cycle of depression. Most of the time now i do not know what to do with myself anymore, nothing sounds interesting, or fun anymore. I have tried dating that ended with me being heartbroken and leaving me with a backpack amount of belongings. I quit my job amid heavy stress and anxiety. I just feel nothing now, sure i have the occasional laugh, but mainly i just feel like a husk. I have tried getting back out and trying to find someone else that i can get along with and feel like myself around but it just does not feel possible anymore. I am just about ready to give up because at this point i do not care anymore, i lost everything.I was just wondering if that is common among depressed folks. I just realized I have A LOT of thngs I need to do. I think I did this because I need to feel that I am good enough at somethig and that I have some self worth.Meditation is the best way to get over depression.  Meditate until you can clear your mind off of things you think you think too much about.Hello. I have been, I guess you can say Internet friends with someone. Now recently she has revealed to me that she has been off her meds without her psychiatrist knowing. I encouraged her to talk with her psychiatrist (which was fucking stupid, because you know), but I am not sure I convinced her. She told me that she does not have the energy to respond to people anymore. Now what would you do in a situation like this. I want to help her get better but I do not know her IRL. Thank you for any of your responses.I have posted before a few times in the depression thread. This time I am posting something where i do not know where to post it. I would not say I am alcohol dependant i do not need to have a drink everyday but i do know i have a problem with alcohol. I believe my problem with alcohol stems from my mental health. Over the past 7 days I have managed to drink 30 bottles or over of beer (330ml) on 2 separate occasions. I have not blacked out or had hangover after doing this. When i drink i do not even know why i do it before i faced my mental health it was to numb my feelings to try and cope but one suicide attempt and 6 months of anti depressants later (should\\nof gone for counselling but covid 19 stopped that for time being) it is not like that now. Its like I am drinking for sake of it but the intake is only becoming more. I am genuinely scared I am on this slippery slope of an abyss and I am going over the edge. it is like my negative or coping behaviour has not gone away even tho my mental health has massively improved. I think what I am saying is I am reaching out for help but do not know what for...I have had a week off over Easter and even though I have not really done anything while I have been on vacation (lockdown, yay) I can not face going back tomorrow morning. it is exacerbating my intrusive thoughts too which is always a joy /sarcasmThe small amount of people left in my life will never know of me being gone and will not bother to reach out. Therefore no one will know and be negatively impacted. Everybody winsI am in such an early point in life that if I have no want to do anything ever then my whole entire future will be ruined. if I have a future at all.\\n\\nI have always lived by this philosophy. where when you die you look back on your life. and that I should make as many happy memories as possible. I have tried to make happy memories, but whenever I do there is always someone or something to fuck it all over.\\n\\nI have always wanted to be an artist. for my GCSE\\'s I picked commercial art. I hope that is what makes me motivated to do anything. whenever I try to practise drawing or anything like that my fucking gaming addiction pulls it all away just for some little dopamine. I try to get whatever happiness I can get from anything but there is always something that is out there to ruin someone\\'s day. and almost always it is mine.\\n\\nI have decided I am going to stay up all fucking night tonight. atlest as long as I can last. to try and finf some way of getting out of my hellhole that I have found myself in. try and find a way to make life easier. to make life more happier.\\n\\nI am going to ask my parents about meds. going on my Xbox is the only thing that gives me a sort of emotion and I have felt that emotion slowly drain away throughout the past couple of years. I want to stop it before it gets too bad. obviously we should start it all after this whole coronavirus shit has stopped.\\n\\nwish me luck for tommorow.I know many pple that self harm have partners, and I do not mean to offend anyone that has scars, but for me personally I find it it impossible to feel comfortable letting pple see my scars... Some people do not  mind showing their scars but I never ever had the courage to be comfortable w them, when I am in a situation where there are visible I get so anxious that I start disassociating, almost like I am levitating or in a dream, Idk how to explain.. I never had a very good self esteem and having scars all over my body definitely does not help bc there is nothing I can do to make these fade away, I started at 14 and I am in my early 20s and I still have the scars so it this point I just wonder how anyone would love me.. To anyone that considers starting SH pls do not, it is toxic af and it can be very addicting.. Never in my life I thought I would SH and it started when I was at my worse and now I just do that as my coping mechanism..As of now I am failing everything but I tell my mom that I am passing and I am studying when instead I lock into my room and cry and then make myself feel better by watching videos. I feel like a horrible human being for lying to my mom about failing. The main reason is I am to depressed to even study and I am going through a secret heartbreak that just happened recently. I also lie to others that I am doing well in life. I feel like I deserve what is happening to me by lyingM19 here in my second year of medical school. I met this girl who is really smart and pretty and gets amazing grades. Now I get pretty good grades too but not anywhere near her. So I guess I kinda started liking her. But now I am jealous of her grades and overall likability while also jealous of any other guy she is friends with. I eventually got really bitchy about it and we started fighting all the time. One day, something silly set me off and I told her that I did not want to be friends anymore. she is the type who does not forget stuff so no chance of us being friends again for sure. But I still feel competitive towards her. And lockdown, honestly, as much as I know it is wrong, I do not want it to end, so I do not have to face her or anyone else again.\\n Not sure if I just wanted to rant or not but I hope I can get some advice or a friend. Either will do me good.He has not gotten tested yet, due to this corona stuff, but his doctor thinks that might be the case. Apparently my grandparents both died from cancer at a young age, he might be next. Too scared to figure out if it is hereditary, which is ironic given that I sometimes fantasize about getting some condition that will kill me. But looking at how much he is suffering, going out on my own terms looks so much better.\\n\\nAnd to make things worse, my mom was really distressed about it, and she called me and made me promise that I will graduate. I just could not tell her that my depression has been making me doubt if it will happen at all. This shitty quarantine has been slowly destroying my mental health. it is gotten so bad that I relapsed and started to self harm again. This is not helping at all.I am an ugly, weird, socially awkward, mentally I will outcast that everyone either feels sorry for or makes fun of. \\n\\nI have been battling with depression for more than a decade now and I am only 23. I have been on countless medications, been to numerous inpatient and outpatient facilities, and talked to plenty of therapists. All the self improvement and self care I do will not change the fact that I am ugly.\\n\\nI suffer from severe depression and anxiety because of how people have treated me based on how my face looks. I have been bullied, manipulated, talked down to and dehumanized by people for almost all of my life because of something I can not even fucking control. I did not ask to look like this. I did not ask to be born by a hideous father who can not even be a father to his son.\\n\\nI have very few good friends and I feel like even they befriend me for sympathy. I have had girlfriends and I am currently in a relationship but I feel like she is not even attracted to me like that. I am a good guy and everything but I am ugly. You can say girls will look past that all you want but sexual attraction is necessary in a healthy relationship. it is becoming clear that I do not do that for her.\\n\\nIf I was not ugly, my life would be completely different. And no I do not want to hear that bullshit \"it is what is on the inside that counts\". Many do not know what it is like to experience the lookism people like me face. At the end of the day, humans judge other humans by how they look. I am repulsive looking due to my big oddly shaped nose.  People have and will either make fun of me, be overly fake nice to me to feed their ego or be genuinely friendly to me yet feel sorry for me. It may not seem that bad for the average person reading this but if you were in my shoes, you would have killed yourself years ago.\\n\\nMy mom is the only thing keeping me here but part of me feels like she will become stronger if I end my life. No one else besides her really cares about me.\\nMy childhood and adolescence sucked and adulthood is going to be even harder. Why keep living  a life that has been cursed by my facial features? I might as well just kill myself and do everyone including myself a favorOne group really wants me to further apply and keeps trying to reach me, they are saying I could qualify for a lot of new studies. \\n\\nI am hesitant to respond, I am not sure what to expect. I do not want to be a guinea pig for new medication.I recently rewatched Rocketman, the movie, and when the song Rocketman started playing I started crying uncontrollably for no reason. I then cried until I fell asleep and I dreamed a memory I thought I have forgotten. \\n\\nWhen I was 13 my mom would drag me to the public pool so she could lay in the sun and roast like a slice of bacon. I did not have friends to invite so it was just me, alone, or with my cousin that I hated so even there I preferred being by myself. \\nI hated my body so I spent time on the deeper side of the pool. Goggles on, I went deep underwater and stayed there until I could not breathe and I had to go back up to get some air. \\nThere, underwater, was my safe space. I could see people’s feet far away painted blue, the loud screaming of kids and splashing disappeared, it was just me, watching things almost in slow motion while I was dreaming of being someone else. \\n\\nI mean, I was still a kid so I dreamed of being a My Little Pony character because I did not know better, but fuck, I was 13 and all I wanted was to disappear, be someone else, be happy. \\nSo many times I cried there, my goggles fogged up so I had to stop crying, compose myself and go back up. No one noticed because my eyes could have been red for the chlorine, and no one noticed because no one cared. \\n\\nI was so unhappy. \\nI am still unhappy. I still daydream about being someone else, people see me as someone happy because often I zone out with a big smile on my face, where I dream about being adopted by people that love and care about me. \\nInstead I have a mentally abusive father and someone that when I told them I wanted to end it all, they ignored me and went on a rant about using period pads as a facemask.I am a 29F single, nurse. This covid and quarantine is obviously exacerbating the issue of loneliness. Recently went through a breakup so that along with social distancing probably led me into this funk, but I feel so defeated and hopeless. And this is not the first time in life I have gone through this. it is a familiar feeling of sadness that I have found myself coming back to every few years or so. Like nothing I ever do will be enough or make me feel content. I have always been an over thinker, and even when I have something good going (like when I thought my relationship was great), I can not fully enjoy it because I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Life’s always taught me that something will eventually disappoint and of course it did. I found out my ex told so many lies and it is not so much that situation that makes me sad anymore. it is the feeling that I try to be a good person, by any standards I think I am a pretty decent catch, but I keep getting shit on. Now I know I am not a complete victim and there are things I need to work on internally, but I can not help but feel like what‘s the point?\\n\\nI grew up as an only child whose parents were terrible with finances - gamblers, credit card debt, living beyond their means, not reaching for higher pay. All I ever told myself was to become the first in the family to achieve the highest level of education - never thinking about finances or complete life goals. I have a masters degree, but I also now have $120k in student loan debt to pay back. A few years into nursing and I am finally making decent money now, about 85k but I have really gotten myself into a hole here. I feel like I will never be out of debt and will never escape the bad habits that I have grown up with. For example, my mom did not really set up many activities for me as a child so I spent a lot of time playing alone while she slept most of the time. Sometimes we would go to the mall or out to eat and even more rarely we took a few trips to Vegas and a couple other states. But most of my childhood years/early teen years were spent at home, trying to keep myself occupied with random kid things.\\n\\nI know my parents were not taught much about leading a responsible life either and they did the best they could. But I can not help and feel resentful about where I am in life now. This is definitely partly depression talking, but also feelings that have been slowly manifesting for a long time and things I have never dealt with.\\n\\nI prefer to avoid problems and not deal with them. I prefer to sleep all day unless I am out socializing or partying with friends.\\n\\nOver the past year, I have become more and more aware and alarmed by my financial situation and dissatisfaction with life. I have been trying to educate myself more on finances, set up budgets, learn about investments. I work overtime sometimes, but bedside nursing can be stressful and tiresome. Another thing I am not totally sure I chose correctly. But ultimately, I am still that girl that would rather lay in bed and not deal with problems. I tend to find distractions and feel productive for awhile until it all comes crashing down and I am back to that familiar feeling of being sad, lonely, hopeless and a failure. \\n\\nCan anyone out there relate to any part of this? Has anyone overcome these bad habits (for good)? I do not think I have ever responded well to the “just do it” mantras, all that is done is make me want to sleep more and give up altogether if I am being honest.\\n\\nAppreciate any feedback and hope you are all staying sane and doing well during these tough times. <3\\n\\nTLDR; always feel inadequate and can not let myself be happy, masters degree but over 115k in debt now, feeling defeated and depressed/would rather sleep all day. Can anyone relate and have you overcome these bad habits?(If it even going to be over...) I am getting used to not being productive and sleeping all day.Like I said before I have not felt okay or even content in a long time and I have not felt real happy in months now. Lockdown made me realize that my life is empty and I am nothing but a worthless oaf who should have killed himself when he had the chance.\\nI have never had real friends in real life and i never had a gf in real life as I never felt like I fit in my society in Egypt, I always felt like a stranger here\\nAll my friends are internet friends and my old relationships were long distance relationships.\\nI have nothing to live for, my dreams are dead and I do not enjoy anything I do right now. what is the point of living if you go through everyday feeling dead inside like this??\\nI go to bed every single day praying to God to let me die in my sleep as I can not take this pain anymore\\nFeeling worthless is so painful it feels like I am getting stabbed by thousands of daggers and swords and I am really tired of being like this. I will never feel happy and I will never find joy again I guess death is my only optionI used to be able to devote hours of my life to working on things which I love doing but now doing a task which is as short as 1 hour is almost unthinkable. It feels like some of the few thinks which made me \"interesting\" or gave value to my life is the stuff that I worked on, but now I feel worthless because I can not even work on those things any more.\\n\\nThe worst part is that this not only effected my hobbies but it is also effecting my schooling and I feel like I fucked up my chances at getting into the colleges I wanted in this past year alone. Also, my SAT / ACT scores were supposed to save me but now there is a good chance I will not even get to take either of those tests and I feel almost hopeless bc now I can not count on testing or work ethic and it feels like there is nothing going for me.I am posting this for those who need to hear it. I personally know people going through it really hard right now, due to the isolation (which can breed negative thoughts) and anxiety due to what is going on with the world right now. \\n\\nI just want you to know, everyone here supports you and we wish you well through these times. Please keep your head up and do not forget, you are loved!I am 24 and life has not gotten better for me. I have no friends , no family... All I have is a \"friend\" who thinks my mental disorders and depression are not real and that I am just a pussy who thinks way too much. My feelings are not valid according to my friend. So I shut off. Numbed myself up. Today I almost cut myself for the first time in ages. Today for the first time I went to the suicide hotline only to wait 20 minutes in the chat. Nobody came to chat with me. So I gave up and closed the page.\\nAll I ask is for a girl to come into my life to truly love me and understand me. I am tired of being blamed for my childhood traumas. I am sorry if my writing is bad. I am feeling very empty right now. Idk if anyone will even read this but.. thank you if you do.it is been an ongoing battle for over 13 years now, I have been up but I always come crashing down, this time though I can not see a way back up. I stopped seeing my psych, am off all medication and have been for 2 weeks now for the first time in over a decade, by choice.\\nI am using heavy drugs more often to cope with how I feel, I can not communicate with people normally anymore, I stutter my words, I am constantly agitated and my eyes dart around when people try conversating with me. People do not want to be around me any more, I can feel it. I feel like the most annoying digusting unlikeable piece of shit more than I ever have and nobody proves me wrong, they do not know how fragile I have become.\\nI really need some proper help but I am too proud and scared to ask for any. I let down everyone as it is. I do not want to do this shit anymore, but I will.I have definitely felt this too early. My buddy is engaged. ENGAGED. we are 19. I am happy for him do not get me wrong at all here, but like... I am too young for this to be a because of my depression to strike but it has and I have had a lot of gin tonight to try and hide how bad it feels. I mean, this guy is engaged at the same age as me and I have never had any relationship. I have been pretty free of self harm/suicidal thoughts for a while now since I quit harming a few years back and stopped being suicidal before, but I thought I was okay with the possibility that I would die by myself because I am not comfortable with sex, and that is stopping all relationships, and I was chil lwith thag but now someone I know is getting married, others have had children, and I have not even felt the love of another person and honestly? I cried and felt a little oncje edge of suicidal again because I may always be this, congratulating people on their lives while mine moves no where because I can not be loved when I will not have sex and I am useless at everything else.\\n\\nI will say I am sure this does not make much sense because I have had quite a bit to drink tonight but I do not drink much unless I am drepressed so really if you can offer any kind of consolation I would be grateful thank you love you stay safeI am done fucking faking happiness infront of my famiky ,GF and my best friend , i jusy want to go ,i just really want to , i need toHi, this is a poem I wrote today to try to explain how I have been feeling lately. I just want to share it to see if anyone else feels this way as well. \\n\\n\\nTomorrow Will Be a Better Day\\n\\nLast night I laid in my bed\\nassured that tomorrow will be a better day \\nThe night sky guarded me from the pressures\\nand expectations of success\\nunder her protection, \\nI can rest\\nand make empty promises to myself\\nthat tomorrow will be a better day\\n\\nEvery night I lay \\nand replace myself with thoughts \\nof  a new self\\n\\nFilled with hope, I tell myself\\ntomorrow will be a better day\\n\\nThe morning sun kisses the blinds\\nI closed not so long ago\\nThey filter in uninvited and chant their alarm\\n\\nIt is tomorrow\\n\\nBut I was wrong, I am still me\\nno matter how many times I wake up\\nthe rest was never enough to \\nmake today a better dayHey everyone. it is VENT TIME!\\n\\nWhy is it that I can think of improving myself in any way possible, know how to make that happen in an efficient and not overbearing manner, and still fail to change at all like a fucking loser?\\n\\nWhenever I think about the sort of person that I have become, I can not help but feel disgusted and ashamed. How could I have turned out to be such a huge pile of human trash? I mean, I fully acknowledge my own faults and yet I never fix them. I end up living in misery like usual because it feels way more comfortable than any sort of minor change.\\n\\nI know that I am being too hard on myself when I call myself \"human maggot\" or something stupid like that but I can not help it. I am the biggest fucking loser I know. Whenever someone talks to me and supports me to change for the better, I say \"yeah I know, I know. I doing that, little by little\". How can I such that to them with a straight face?? And not only that, but I also give them constructive opinions so that they can also change for the better or feel happier! That would not be too bad in of itself, but those words come out of the mouth of a fucking obnoxious hypocrite!\\n\\nAgain, Iknow that I should try to avoid referring to myself in such a negative manner but I just can not anymore. I am trash.\\n\\nObviously enough I am going through a tantrum and acting like an angsty teen (even though I am already in my 20\\'s), so please try to ignore the obvious \"heat of the moment\" crap in this post. I just needed to vent like crazy but I refuse to talk to my parents of friends. I do not want to seem vulnerable or weak to them/push them away for appearing too emotional (I am aware that they are not the kind of people to do that, but I am overtly scared and cynical).\\n\\nIf you can relate to any of this and have any suggestions to get better and improve my willpower, please leave them below. I would love to hear them.\\n\\nI hope you all have a great day. CheersI just want to giwe up on everything99% of the stuff I unload is just shit people \"need\" to do things at home while they are quarantined...\\n\\nThe other 1% is essential, like some food items, but mostly cleaners and stuff.\\n\\nI hate my job to begin with, and now I am stuck because so many places are closed/out of business/not hiring since everyone\\'s mostly home.\\n\\nI do not know how essential I feel. It feels more essential to the business not tanking than it is to actual moving product for people in neighboring communities.\\n\\nThey also play a corporate video on a loop, and it feels like propaganda. I feel like I am losing my mind even more than I have.\\n\\n\"Well you are lucky to have a job.\" do not go there...that is not what this is about...\\n\\nit is about how this aspect of my life is feeding my depression even more than anything else right now, and I repeat, I feel like I am losing my mind...Every joy lasts for a few moments the rest are sad.\\nFuck.I have been depressed since i was 16, I am 22 now, and I feel like I have to deal with depression, i have to do stuff and be successful, especially as an adult.I hate my birthdays,\\n\\nI stopped liking them when gifts were not that exciting anymore and when they started triggering my social anxiety. So pretty early on.\\n\\nNow I am 25 and I just hate them even more. For me birthdays are just “planned in advanced mental breakdowns”. I already know I am going to be miserable and cry all day. \\n\\nIt forces me to face reality: I hate my life. I am nowhere near what I wanted to be at that point when I was younger. Things did not go the way I wanted them to go and every year I have less and less time to do something about it. I am just becoming uglier and older.\\n\\nI am going to have to fake being happy when my family is calling me... otherwise my mom is going to be sad.\\n\\nI do not want any attention... I do not want gifts... i do not want cake and candles. Gifts make me so uncomfortable... But at the same time because I am a stupid idiot I will also feel very sad if people forget me or follow my “no gift rule”. Because then I am going to think “that is what you are worth. Nobody really cares anyway”. I am so annoyed at myself for having contradicting feelings like that. I just know whatever happens I am going to be sad and disappointed. \\n\\nThe lockdown situation is going to make it even worse. I am working from home atm so I will not be really and legitimately busy enough to not answer calls and read texts. I usually go to the cinema by myself so I can be alone without my phone... this year I will not be able to. I will not be able to escape reality with a nice walk or whatever.\\n\\nit is going to be a nightmare and it already started. My boyfriend told me he was planning on bringing me gifts that I do not want... i told him months ago that I did not want anything - He just does not understand. How can I be mad at that eh? \\n\\nI am just an ungrateful asshole. it is such a shitty and stupid problem, especially when people are sad for real reasons like because of the fucking pandemic killing people they love. I can not help it.. it makes me hate myself even more...i feel so stupid for this. i absolutely HATE people looking through my things and belongings, and i know that when i die it will be done. so i have not killed myself. my mom has already gone through my shit a few times so i do not know why it even matters now. i just want to disappear and that be it. \\n\\ni hope this makes sense oofI spend so much of my time doing absolutely nothing at all.  My main issue is everything seems so much more enjoyable in my head as opposed to when I actually do whatever I was thinking about.  Has anyone experienced that? It just drags me down and I spend my days coming up with ideas of things to do and then not having a good time.  My motivation is completely sapped, making it near impossible for me to do the basic everyday things I need to do.  I do not know what to do with myself.I think I messed up my taxes or something. I am only getting $66/week in unemployment, that extra $600 a week is not showing up even though it is supposed to be for everyone on unemployment. And everyone has been getting that $1200 stimulus check, meanwhile it is saying there is nothing available for my account.\\n\\nI worked part time for minimum wage, and I can not even figure out how to get benefits. that is how pathetic I am.\\n\\nIf that money does not come through by next week, I do not know what I am going to do. If I can not do something as simple as this, it might be time to call it quitsI am no longer close with this friend even though we live in the same city. I have gotten together with her twice last year just to reconnect.  I know she leads a busy life with her husband and kids but during this pandemic they are all home. \\n\\nI am going to a farm an hour away to pick up maple syrup which it is cheaper to buy in a large quantity as opposed to buying a small jar in the grocery store.\\n\\nI sent her and another friend a text that if they would like to buy also  I will drop off the jug at their doorstep. My one friend declined since her mother had purchased some for her already and thanked me for thinking of her. But the other friends\\' response was \"Lol, your too funny. We are all good for Maple Syrup, we have lots\".\\n\\nI am taken aback by her response. Am I reading into this too much?Basically the title. I have been crying more than usual recently and honestly just lying on your back with a pillow on your face is so good.\\n\\nI dunno if it is the wet fabric or the knowledge that if any pressure was applied it would smother me to death but it is so much better than crying regularly.Hi guys, I am 16 years of age nearly 17 , I have had a great life, nothing to be sad about but over the last week or two I have been showing all the signs of depression; breaking down over the smallest things, no motivation to do anything, tired all the time and just that general emptiness, I have been smoking weed for a a year or 2 now and everyday for the past few months, I am not sure if this is why I am depressed or what but I just wanted to ask a few questions, \\n1) would quitting cannabis be a good idea? And why? \\n2) please give me some advice on the best ways you found to cope with depression.\\n3) and finally, does it get better because right now I feel it never will:/ \\nThank you in advance to anyone commenting, just know your helping. ❤️For me it is a mess the only thing that used to bring me happiness were my friends which I am great full for. But everyone says stay in touch but dose any one actually no how hard that is. The foundation of my happiness is gone I can only hope that this virus ends soon.I am tired of dissagreements. I just want peace. I fucking hate drama. Why can not people just agree with something for once?\\nI am 20 years old male\\nI came across a health issue 6 months ago and how I dealt with it is.. eye opening.\\n\\nI had some stomach issues stem up. There was a thought in my mind that I had bowel cancer because I had all the symptoms, blood in stool, constipation, you name it. The night before my blood tests and a stool test that looks for blood, I cried thinking about it. What was I thinking about? I was imagining that the doctor says they found what I was fearing. Then I started thinking what I would tell my family. Would I lie? Say that I love them all and they have been all I ever wanted and more? \\n\\nOr would I tell the truth? Would I tell them how I truly felt about them? Maybe so they could change? Would I tell them that I do not mind if something in my bowels is going to kill me?\\n\\nI mean, I am not going to lie, when I had that fear from built up anxiety, I actually wanted to live. I really did. But here I am months later, back to my normal life. Why did these feelings go? Why can not I get this feeling when I am healthy? Why am I suicidal now, but when I was close to “death” I wanted to live so badly?\\n\\nMind you, this is not the first night that I felt this way. I have had uncountable nights and days that I had this feeling. In fact, 6 years ago when I was 13 I dreamed that I blew my h*** off with a shotg** in the balcony. Then I turned into a ghost and went inside my house, telling my family how Sorry I am but nobody replies or sees me. I woke up crying. Since that dream I promised myself I would never do such a thing. My thoughts might say that they are better off without me, but I know, from that dream, that if I go that way I will not make anything better. \\n\\n\\nI just do not get why I came into existence. I want to die. Why can not I just die? What do I do?I just need someone in my life to hug me thight so i feel comfortable... never had someone ever and i promise that I will treat her like a queen.. please god... let her come and save me from my depression and loneliness... i want to love someone... i want to be loved... i want to be valuable to someone... i want someone to understand me how i feel and accept how i am... If one day i meet that person, my life could change forever...As the title says, my boyfriend goes through periods of depression. he will be fine one week and the next his brain will be telling him it would be easier if he were not around.\\n\\nObviously I absolutely hate seeing him go through this, and I try to do simple things like make him great meals and pick movies to watch I think he will love etc--but I do not really know how to best support him. I know I can not fix things for him but I would love to ease them a little even.\\n\\nAny suggestions?my sister has depression but sometimes i feel like she feels she is the only one allowed to feel sad. i have not ever told her how sad i get sometimes because she usually offers advice like going outside or learn a hobby. I have sought counseling and was referred to a therapist but i have not told my family because I am so scared of the reaction. i was even prescribed anti depressants, which i have not taken because they are so expensive and I am worried about withdrawals.\\n\\nthe other day i responded to her i do not really have any hobbies and her response was like \"if we felt that way about everything, we would not get anything done.\"\\n\\nany time i reference depression she makes me feel like i do not know what I am talking about.\\n\\nthank you for reading, have a nice day you allI literally have no idea why I still exist.  There are people who actually enjoy living and are happy and have so much going for them.  I do not contribute anything valuable to the world.  All I do is take up space.  Thank goodness I will be dead later this year.  That brings me a sense of peace.My fathers wife died. When I met her and my father a few years ago I could tell she was the one who was really trying to make up for lost time. she is been there for me and I genuinely loved her. No one told me about her passing. I only saw a snapchat post from my sister. I feel like I am about to break. there is the grief from her passing mixed with all of my issues with rejection combined into one nice emotional break down.like no response or explanation to your lack of interest in responding to them when they reach out or check in with you but you have got no energy to reply to them since it is overwhelming or too much\\n\\nhow do you react when you enjoy their company and they seem upset when seeing them after getting over a depressive episode: explain, leave them be, etc.?A bit of background - I am a 22 year old male. Growing up I was very sensitive to peoples feelings, the world around me, found everything funny and was all in all a very happy, caring and loved person.\\n\\nThrough high school I smoked weed maybe once or twice every 6 months or so, so not a lot... mostly because I was sensitive to it and had strong reactions. \\n\\nAnyway, at 17 some buddies and I camped out overnight. My life has never been the same after that night. I had a soul destroying terrifying experience that truly can not be explained with words. I can only describe it as an episode in which I experienced the most extreme physical pain, fear, terror, paranoia, anxiety, crazy visuals, blacking out, my sight was MESSED up, losing control of my entire body, and so SO much more for several hours before ‘reality’ started to return I never really spoke about it because my words really do not do it justice at all. It was literally hell and my brain went through something extreme, I know it.\\n\\nThings were a bit weird after this but nothing too noticeable. Looking back, this is when my life went from being colourful to slowly fading away. I am no brain expert but I feel like my brain was so deeply traumatised that it changed into some sort of safety mode, causing me to feel NOTHING and empty, all the time.\\n\\nMy symptoms;\\n- I feel empty all the time. I can not remember the last time I felt any emotion, good or bad.\\n- anhedonia ( I can not remember the last time I really felt pleasure from anything )\\n- no sex drive what so ever (this was not the case before the accident) \\n- erectile dysfunction \\n- basically I can not feel anything, it is like my brain does not react to anything that happens anymore. I do not remember the last time I genuinely laughed.\\n-I can not cry, I sometimes lie in bed trying so hard to cry but nothing happens.\\n- I used to have a sense of self, I feel like a walking dead body now with nothing going on inside of me\\n- constantly fatigued and do not care about anything \\n- loss of imagination and my thoughts are so distant and empty\\n\\nI have tried Zoloft on a 100mg dose for 3 months and felt no change what so ever in me. I have tried mirtazapine 30mg for 3 months and nothing happened other than appetite increase.\\n\\nPlease help, I would love to be the old me again.\\n\\nEdit : the symptoms list was not exhaustive and this post only really touched the surface, so any questions please ask!I trusted you before you dated my mom. I lost trust when I told my family you made me nervous. I lost trust when you stared at me. I lost trust when you dated my mom.....I lost trust when you assaulted me....I lost trust when you did it again....I lost trust when you did it a 3rd time....I lost trust when you got me taken away. I lost trust when you were still here when I came back. I lost trust when you thought I would forget. I lost trust when you married my mom. I lost trust when you won in court. I gained trust when I started to forget...I gained trust when I tried to convince myself it was my fault. I gained trust, but only when my mom started asking me to, but whatever you gain, I lose. I wish I knew what it was like to be loved by a man, but not through sexual desire, to have someone walk me down the isle when I am getting married, someone who was there to help me with the hard homework, someone who would joke around with me, someone who would love me as a daughter. I am still a kid in my eyes, why are my body parts the only thing you see, why can not you be proud of me, WHY did not MY REAL DAD WANT ME!\\nyou are not my real dad...I want to go somewhere far away. Away from this country. Probably live in the countryside or mountains alone and just read.\\n\\nI hate being in the city. Everything is loud. Everything is a mess. Being quarantined with my family messes me up more. I will probably kms before I get to do it. I want to leave.\\n\\n I want a peace of mind. My mind is in a haze right now. I could only think of one quick solution to be at peace.Around a year ago I fell into quite a bad depression as well as anxiety. In order to save time I will not go into the details of my personal symptoms. \\n\\nHowever for the last 3-4 months, I have been making quite a big effort to pull myself out of the depression with some success. However from time to time daily I do fall back into my old thought patterns. During this time I usually managed by keeping to myself(for 2-3hrs) and making an effort to keep myself busy through one of my hobbies (I am 17 and live with my family so talk to them regardless of my mood). Usually my sprinting practice is the most successful at getting me out of the mental state. \\n\\nVery recently I began speaking to a counselor (online due to the quarantine circumstances). It has not caused much difference yet but I am still hopeful. The counselor recommended that I still reach out to 1 or 2 closer friends during times where I feel like this. This is different to my usual method however I was happy to try it.\\n\\n**The main issue:**\\n\\nWhen choosing someone to talk about it with, I chose a friend who I know had also been through a similar mental struggle and had opened up to me about it. When this happened, I was always happy to talk to him and help him through it. Therefore I assumed it would be good to talk with him as he would be able to relate. \\n\\nHowever, when I have tried talking about what I am going through with him after a few messages he will just leave my message unopened (for around a day), this is unusual because if we are having a usual conversation he would reply sooner. After having done this he will begin a conversation on a completely different topic. Basically ignoring what I said before. The first time this happened I just ignored it thinking that it was probably a coincidence. I spaced out each attempt by a few weeks. However after the 2nd and 3rd time it began to bother me. Especially when I see him posting on his story or group-chats etc.\\n\\nTherefore, I am wondering if anyone has had something similar happen? and what did they do about it? Should I just communicate what I have noticed and be honest that it is bothering me (this feels quite odd for me to do as I am usually quite a jokey person and we usually joke around together).In high school, everyone told me that when you turned 18 you had to go be independent and self sufficient. My first year of college went ok. But the second year, I became profoundly depressed. I stopped going to classes and my grades suffered. I thought at the time maybe that I was just gaming the system by skipping class because you can skip class in college with fewer consequences. But what was really going on was that I was depressed and I spent all this time on Facebook or just staring at my wall and listening to music, feeling sorry for myself. But I never wanted help because I never wanted to look weak. And I never realized there was a problem with an expectation that you avoid looking weak at all costs. That was an undeniable fact life had taught me (so I thought). I did not realize I was still affected by my childhood trauma. I did not talk to anyone. I spent years like that, trying to work and study and always being fucked over by depression/trauma, and failing to recognize it as such. I thought I was just worthless, unable to work hard because of some internal defect. I remember scouring the DMV thinking I had to have some personality disorder. I became obsessed with introversion and the MBTI because I then thought \"oh I can not do the shit I need to do because I am an INTP trapped in an extrovert feeler world\". I kept deluding myself by following every failure with an \"it must be because I am too smart for everything\" pep talk. My life is not a bed of roses now, but at least I acknowledged I needed help for depression and PTSD, and got it. \\n\\nAnyway, TL;DR is that I spent over a decade in denial of my trauma and depression.So figured I would type this out on how I felt on this since it sucks. First off, my family has a history with depression. I know my grandmother has it, my father has it, and my grandfather may have had it too. Ever since middle school just year after year I felt worse and worse. Now I am 23 with one good real life friend (who is my best friend) and one good online friend. Been single for like 7-8 years and just hate it. A long time ago had some of my old friends confide in me about being suicidal (even my best friend) and I tried to help them out the little I could (fortunately they are still with us). Though that is left me with no one I felt like I could turn to.   \\nOnce out of high school I felt like I was in a swamp. Its thick muddy waters that makes it hard to move in. While you got all sorts of dangerous creatures like alligators and snakes watching your every move. On top of the blood sucking mosquitoes and leeches that latch onto to you day after day. At first I would try my best to move forward you know, try to get somewhere, to get out of the swamp but no matter how hard I tried, how fast I moved, I always wound up back in the same spot of the swamp. I would see lights and hear voices and I would go toward them and yell out with my arm reaching for anything, but nothing ever happened and again I was in the same spot. As days went on, my will to move forward, call out, reach out, all faded away. But I am an insane fool, and every so often I try again, reaching, moving, yelling, only to end up back in my little spot. I get rid of the leeches and swat the mosquitoes and even chase away the snakes but I do not bother with the alligator. because I wake up every morning, wishing that I did not. Every day it feels like I look at that alligator and ask \"Why have not you eaten me yet?\" and I never get an answer.  \\nSo I am just standing still, in my little spot. Watching as things go by, and people pass me. Waiting for the day where either someone finally pulls me out or the day that gator finally gets me.as the title saysBeen binging it today, read for seven hours and will continue. Man I can relate to him. If you like their music, have a history of depression and drug use, I recommend it. It seems like it is been giving me some strength.So on Twitter a few days ago, I saw [this article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-making-a-lot-of-people-anxious-and-depressed-but-some-sufferers-actually-feel-better-now). Basically, it talks about how a minority of people with depression/anxiety are actually feeling better in the midst of this pandemic.\\n\\nThe causes of what I am feeling are not really talked about in the article, but I mention it for some context.\\n\\nThis pandemic is inflicting widespread suffering and I would give back every moment I have had of happiness so that it would go away this instant. But like..I am feeling pretty good? \\n\\nI think it is because in times of crisis, humanity tends to come together. I have communicated more with my friends in the past few weeks than I normally do. we have played MarioKart and Animal Crossing online, we have video-called, we are starting up a tabletop game...I have not been allowed in sink into my depressive habit of isolating myself and then wondering why no one will reach out to me.\\n\\nit is...really nice. it is given me the motivation to do more chores and get interested in my old hobbies again. I just wish this awful virus did not have to be (at least part of) the reason why I am experiencing this. :\\\\\\\\\\n\\nAnybody else relate??Please look at my last post for more information. I will not be linking it here.\\n\\nBut basically, I want to delete my memories. Memory loss hypnosis videos do not work on me. Can you find a way so that I can lose my memories permanently? I had enough of them. I WANT THEM GONE!I have never posted here but I can not see my friends and reaching out to any of them is just going to make me feel like a burden.\\nMy professors will put in emails \"how is working from home\" or \"how are you doing\" and i know that i have to falsify and answer because they do not care. \\n\\nThe week i finally decided to apply for Medicaid (my health insurance does not cover therepy)  and get in the process of maybe getting help i got kicked off my campus because of coronavirus, and in person sessions are out of the question in any capacity. This was in mid march. \\n\\nNow I am at home. I live with my sister and parents and my sister at least can acknowledge I am suffering but i feel like my parents can not even fathom what I am going through and i hate them for that. They talk about how terrible this quarantine is when they both work from home and have an easy time waking up every day. I wake up and have to fight myself to even leave my bed. I know they view this as laziness.\\n\\nI feel anxiety even leaving my room now because i do not feel equipped to deal with what is outside my door. \\nI get halfway through making meals sometimes and just stop because its not worth it. If i burn something it usually means I am not eating because i do not have the will to remake it.\\n\\nI get angry with deadlines a lot and hurt myself sometimes. I never really mean to it just kind of happens. I will be working on something that just is not coming together and i feel like i need to take it out on something and I am usually the most deserving thing in the room. I have not cut myself in years but now i just bruise or let myself go hungry.\\n\\nI just have so much fucking damage and I do not know where to start putting it. I have been shoving it under the rug for so long I am pressed up against the ceiling. Sometimes depression does not feel like something i have it feels like something i do. I feel like i choose being depressed over feeding myself, or doing my homework, or interacting with others.\\n\\nI feel like my life is not just on hold but regressing, I feel like all the trauma I have gotten from others and damage I have given myself has no value. All i can think about is how much time I have obliterated feeling bad, and how I am never getting it back, and how I am never going to stop adding to it.\\n\\nI guess the last option is just acceptance that this is my life and hoping the clock runs out as quickly and painlessly as possible.Believe me, if I had half the courage most of the poster seem to have, things would be so much easier. At the same time, due to this, I am desperately holding on the idea that things might get getter in the future so that I can justify my extreme cowardice.\\n\\nWelp, I better start preparing myself for unending disappointment. :/I am sure I am a worthless stupid piece of shit that does not deserve love but sometimes when somebody can not do an easy task to me or sometring like that a rain of narcissict thoughts come to my head saying I am a more smart or better human being than the rest of the world and it makes me feel confused and hate myself even more.At the age of 14 I became depressed, I was lonely and without friends. At the age of 17 I dropped out of school because I was set on ending my life and did not see a point in attending school anymore. At the age of 19 I had spent 2 years in complete solitude at home speaking to no one except exchanging a few words with my parents every now and then, I had grown apathetic towards everything. I think this is were I died, at the age of 19, no longer responsive and without a single care in the world, just a hopeless, jobless, education less bum leeching of his parents waiting for death to claim him. I am now about to turn 21 and I can safely say that I have lost a lot, including the ability to feel shame, the ability to  care for myself, the ability to be happy, the ability to be sad. \\n\\nEverything regarding myself is of no value to me, I value insects above myself. All I have left is empathy and sympathy towards others, which is why I cannot kill myself. And so I am left in limbo, I have got nowhere to go, all I can do is wait and see where fate takes me. I sincerely hope I die.Please be kind in the comments. I am 18 and just really confused.i hate who i am. i hate my mind. i hate that i am insecure. i hate that i am socially anxious. i hate that i am depressed. all of these things make people not want to be around me. i try to be nice but people always leave when i need support. i hate myself. i want to hurt myself but not by cutting - i wish i could physically beat myself up. i have no one and if i died no one would miss me.My friend is born perfect. she is so skinny and just so pretty. She has a fast metabolism, she is short, she is under 100 pounds, she has a big thigh gap, she is like a twig and i want it. i want to be her so bad.No matter where I go I am too stiff. I am too fucking serious. I have taken drugs, alcohol, nootropics, self-help books, videos, affirmations-everything. I am still this weird awkward loser. I am a permanent problem. My brain is forever a permanent problem. I need a permanent solution. Please what is the secret-how can you just talk and be normal?! Even among “loners” I am still the weak one. God I fucking want it to eI am the shadow you never see, the gutter trash you ignore, the rain that forces you to cancel plans, the wind that carries all you love away with it. I am hated, misunderstood, abused, ostracized, discarded, the punching bag.\\n\\n\\nI am the bad guy.\\n\\n\\nBut I am none of that by choice, I am those things because my peers decided it for me.I promised myself that I would have ended it before I turned 18, now I am almost 20 and shit has not gotten any better.I am just a selfish person,i do not care about anyone else except for me. As far as i am concerned,everyone should die. This might sound edgy but i just feel like it. I am really happy with my life,probably happier than 99,9% of people today. I just do not feel like i belong here. I do lots of philosophy in my head about things that bother me like what is right and wrong,why do we live... It just does not seem right,but who am i to say that,i can not even distinguish right from wrong because i do not believe in things like that. I just sometimes feel like i want to fucking kill myself. Lots of people would be hurt by it but i do not really care. Only thing that is stopping me is that i have a life goal. My life goal is childish to some people,to some it seems determined but it is my fucking thing,i do not care what they say. My life goal is to have a good gaming setup and just play games and watch anime. But there is this thing,school in the future work... There is so much more to life than just going to 8 hours a day at work/school,and sleeping 8 hours a day. I do not want to go to school,lemme just do my fucking thing. i was born to enjoy,not to go to school like a fucking retard tied to system. After i accomplish my goal,I am almost 16,so it is going to be soon,I will kill myself. Life without goals is as good as dead. I do not really care about having a wife and a family and all that normal shit. In few years I will probably kill myself. I do not ask for any help because i do not need it. Not afraid of death or anything,but being alive in a world where I am tied to a system just is not for me. I just wanted to throw this out here,huge thanks to people who read it until the end.TL;DR: (Life was perfect a year ago, everything went to shit. do not know how to be more disciplined / productive and do not know where the boundary of ADHD / Depression ends and when me being undisciplined starts)\\n\\nHi. So two years ago I basically was on the top of my game. I was doing really well in school (then a junior in high school), got the job of a lifetime, and had awesome productivity / work life balance. This was also my first year in school being diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive, Anxiety, and Depression. (diagnosed end of sophomore year)\\n\\nEverything fell apart. I lost the job, my dad went to hospital, I accumulated debt by borrowing money from friends while sustaining myself while my dad was in the hospital, grades died, etc.\\n\\nMy dad is now fine, and I am recovering in most aspects in a stable way except my productivity and discipline. \\n\\n(BIG NOTE: My medication has never really been a good thing. I used to be on meds but I have not taken meds regularly in a long time. My meds make my heart rate go crazy and generally worsen every aspect of both my ADHD and Anxiety and essentially only works after the meds wear off and I am on the come down.)\\n\\nI have so many aspirations. I want to continue doing design. I want to pursue music too. I want to do well in school. I want to continue to watch a ton of YouTube and anime and such and be cultured and on top of what is going on in the world right now. Yet this is an example of how my days have been going.\\n\\n10 AM: I wake up. \\n1 PM: I work out\\n10 PM: I finish some assignments that are dude before midnight\\n12 AM: PS4 / Anime\\n3 AM: Bed\\n\\nI do not know where the time goes. I do not really enjoy my time, nor am I productive. My friends give me advice which I read and agree that it is logical but yet i still find myself at the end of the day asking what did I just do.\\n\\n😔I had depression since 14 and it was getting progressively worse and worse until I had a breakdown and got kicked out of school. I did go to the doctor but she just stuffed me full of pills and nothing else and therapist my parents found is spiritual so I stopped going to her. My psychiatrist just tells to go outside. She never told me what exactly I have I just assumed from my symptoms. Bipolar depression and social anxiety, can not leave the house because of panic attacks even with medication and can not handle stress at all, I will just have panic attacks and another breakdown. I tried to apply for welfare coming to conclusion I will never be able to work and at least try to focus on my hobbies that I somewhat enjoy and get some little money from them and the welfare. But I got rejected saying \"I see nothing requiring a welfare here\" as the worker looked at the report from my psychiatrist. I managed to get a sick note from my main doctor but that will end soon and I will have to go look for a job or make my parents pay for my insurance and I already think I am a parasite for just living with them and wanting money on things from time to time. I just do not know what to do anymore and would rather die than to put my parents into debt, especially now that so many people lost their jobs. I have gotten bit better after not having to worry about stuff but am sure I would just have more breakdowns if I had to go somewhere daily or have deadlines. But I suppose I am just a lazy piece of shit that should just shut up, stop complaining, man up and get a job.I was doing good staying in, I felt it was a mental restart but now I realize Idk\\nwhat is going on with my job, relationship, life in general I just hope to find my way out this slumpWhat is the point of living if I hate every second of it? I feel like a disappointment, I have done nothing with my life. I have no one and nothing to live for. I want to see the joy in things but at the end of the day I am always alone. So again, what is the fucking point?I am done. I can not deal with this anymore everything is just becoming too much to handle. I do not want to be me anymore. I am sick of constant abuse from my school friends. I am sick of not being able to be with the people I love. I am sick of thinking about the people I have lost. In sick of being alone and I am all around sick of being stuck in this world. I am not supposed to be here.I do not get this. Why do I dislike people but also feel bad without social connection...A bit of hope is such a dark cold world\\n\\n\\nheyyyyy you.\\n\\nyes, you.\\n\\nyou beautiful person.\\n\\nstop scrolling.\\n\\njust stop.\\n\\nbreathe.\\n\\neverything is going to be okay.\\n\\nmaybe it does not seem like it right now..\\n\\nbut I promise it will.\\n\\nmaybe you feel like you are not worth anything.\\n\\nmaybe you feel useless, unwanted, unloved..\\n\\nbut that is not true.\\n\\nyou are worth SO much.\\n\\nand if you just believe...\\n\\nyou can go through this tough time.\\n\\nif you feel like no one cares about you, \\n\\nyou are wrong.\\n\\nthere will always be someone.\\n\\neven I care about you,\\n\\nand honey I do not even know you.\\n\\nkeep going and try to get through it, i\\n\\nknow you can do it. \\n\\nI am not saying it is going to be easy, \\n\\nand you will not cry yourself to sleep some nights.\\n\\nbut you got to keep going, buddy.\\n\\nIt will be ok eventually \\n\\nImagine being a father, a mother, a friend, a lover, a happy person \\n\\nKeep going it will happenI do not want to kill myself but I also really do not want to live my life. A little bit about my thought process. \\n\\nI have had mixed feelings on this label. I am the kind of person who will not test for something so that it does not exist. Like dyslexia, I was offered a test in Uni and did not take it because the answer is no I do not have dyslexia until proven otherwise.\\n\\nI have this same mentality with depression. I also would not even know where to start. people say go see a gp but I have never had one and I am not in a position to see one without my family asking questions. \\n\\nI am also not into self-diagnosis and would never say I have depression. I may be depressed or feeling down from time to time but I just do not know.\\n\\nI have always been self-aware and existential (if that is even a word). I have always thought why this life. Why am I in this body. Why do I have these feelings, these emotions and these motivations or lack of movitation. I feel like there should be a grand scheme to things but I can not dedicate myself to one with no evidence. I would love to believe in reincarnation but what is the point if you can not remember a past life. Id love to believe in afterlife but like does that mean for 80+years you get on earth you get an eternity of just watching sounds tedious. I would love to believe in heaven but then does that mean there is a hell.\\n\\nAnyway down to the main point. I am going to try and put this into words but I do not even know what to call it. I am not suicidal, I do not want to kill myself but at the same time I do not want to carry on living. 1. I do not think I would kill myself 2. Even though I am meh on my family I would not put them through that 3. If a truck ran me over next week my instant thought would not be \"no i have so much to live for\"\\n\\nI feel like I am done with life. I do not want to carry on. I do not want to make decisions that could backfire. I do not want to make a wrong move and regret my past (although I hardly regret things). I do not want to try and get out of my funk and become social again. I have always struggled with friends, my relationships and my passions. My whole life is made up of; I want to do this  I pursue it, get so far and then for whatever reason its done - over with. I do not want to keep doing that.\\n\\nLife is too much of a gamble and I just do not want to risk it. it is like a game and I am done playing but I can not bring myself to quit. I do not enjoy playing I would rather I naturally land on a square and go bankrupt and lose the game (monopoly). it is like I do not want to see what positives are out there I am not ready to risk the negatives and the positives are not enticing anymore I would just rather not play at all. Even if someone said here\\'s a free pass I would rather just not do it.\\n\\nthere is too much unknowns in life and out of it. Does what I do with my life effect my afterlife if there even is one and ultimately do I care.\\n\\nI really do not know what to do. I am sorry for this being so long I just felt like I need to put it into words and see if anyone has experienced similar things.\\n\\nHallucinations\\n\\nHi! I have been on Sertraline for almost a year now. On 150mg a day. I have been to hundreds of doctors as I keep neglecting my treatment and moving but each dr increases my dose and pushes me out the door.\\n\\nRecently I have been having severe symptoms, I have been really strongly visually hallucinating. I am not talking about like an odd shape I literally imagined the floor crumbling underneath me and was convinced I was going to drop in to hell. I saw stuff like the world look like I was trapped in a game, and lots of dark haunting scary looking people. In the night I kept walking up as I was certain I heard someone walking in the house and kept seeing someone walk in to the room who was not there. I have been having severe tremors so sometimes I can not pick anything up and I wake up in the night soaked in sweat. \\n\\nI was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? Do you think this could be the tablets?I am not ok, or am I? I am actually not 100% sure if I am faking it or not at this point.So I posted before about having visual hallucinations on Sertraline (please see other post) \\n\\nI have since come off Sertraline and started coming on to citalopram. Since my last post I have been extremely tired but also very agitated. Like my mind is ping ponging everything possible and getting things confused on the way. I can not seem to finish anything I start because I do not care and my friends have said a lot of things I say do not make sense or are from an old conversation or I have started a new one. I have also been experiencing really distressing thoughts of paranoid nature i was convinced my mum broke in to my house and was stalking me and was convinced I was being followed at night. I am also convinced that my next door neighbour is a murderer. I am feeling more level now and realise that was silly but I am entering a stage of numbness. I have been entering a stage of severe suicide idealation I can not seem to shake and I am worried I will act.  \\n\\nIs this my tablets? Anyone have similar experiencesSo if I kill myself then it is the worst thing ever to my family, but I am thinking of just packing my essentials leaving my phone a driving as far as my truck goes on a tank of gas then walking. No idea where I would walk to maybe somewhere else but I think I have hit the point where I just can not take other people telling me how I should feel and how I should live my life.\\nI have had depression for around 20 years now and it is just awful. I understand those who say it will get better but when it does it is simply when is it going to go downhill again? I have been on the back and forth for years had 2 vehicles totally paid off had 2 jobs that I loved to work at, had the whole thing. But even having financial security, food, shelter, drugs, friends/family. None of it has ever made me happy.\\nWe live in a society that says we need things, people, drugs, or a certain outlook to have a happy life.\\nI do not want to be here anymore, I feel abused. Like I can never be myself because everyone has built up a perception of me and when I act like myself I am ridiculed for being different or told that is not how it works or you can not feel that way.\\nThe problem is I do feel this way and I always have, it is gotten to the point where I believe my own thoughts to be cancerous even if they make me feel better because I have been led to believe I have to be someone and something I just am not and every day I have to pretend that I am ok and love this shit just feels like I am slowly suffocating my real self.\\n\\nI have gotten to the point over the last 3-4 months where I am trying to die. I have pretty much stopped eating fruit in hopes vitamin deficiency will kill me. I try to avoid protein to just waste my muscles away. I have started only drinking alcohol and refusing to intake water, I have had 5 glasses in 2 weeks, just in hopes my kidneys shut down. I have even been trying to smoke cigarettes, which I fucking hate, just because I want to do damage to my lungs and have had asthma so I know they are getting fucked.\\n\\nI feel like if I just leave this life behind, not suicide, then I could possibly become the person who I have always wanted to be. So i either can slowly watch myself rot and pretend to be alright, which what I have done for the last 15 years, or I attempt to try again somewhere else without any past, family or friends.Ok I do not have anyone icould talk fir him I hate my life and myself everybody is around me is afake I can not talk to anyone seriously sometimes I feel iam in dream and I can not wake upFor anyone wanting to know, I am not joking. I am being dead serious.Sometimes my mood changes to being mad for no reason,and i want to be rude purposely.  \\nI feel weird pressure in my chest and i can not stop being rude...  \\nI do not know what is the because is it the pills or just depression ? Every time i feel that pressure in my chest i want to explode and beat the shit out of everybodyI have been struggling with my mental state for a while now, and I have not drawn something good or something at all except for weird doodles in my textbooks for a long time. But just in 3 days I somehow managed to draw these.\\n\\n[1](https://ibb.co/1LnwdVN )\\n\\n[2](https://ibb.co/ykvWQmp )\\n\\n[3](https://ibb.co/j4078QW )\\n\\nI really like the one with blue marker, and I was super surprised to find out that I actually CAN draw something like that (even if that is not anatomically correct or anything)\\n\\nAnyway, I wanted to share these with your bc I thought people here might understand feelings I have tried to express in those drawings\\n\\nThank you for reading this\\n\\nI wish you all the best and hope you all can find a way to feel and express your feelings\\n<3\\n\\nEdit: typed some spaces in between the links so it is easier to click on the one you want to openAnybody else feel sharp mood swings sometimes that are like unbearable? Like a little while ago I woke up from a nap super cranky and now I am just aggressively sad. I know I need to get back to counseling once the pandemic cools down but it just feels like too much work. And over time, leaving my house has become more difficult. But I have no reason to be sad. it is really lame.and that is normal.\\n\\nI know I am a loser\\n\\ni know no one wants to talk to me\\n\\ni know no one wants to be near me\\n\\nI know people look down on me\\n\\ni know I am worthless.\\n\\nwhy is that so hard for everyone else to understand. I am not worthy of kindness or nice things. Strangers understand, but those close to me will not let me shrivel up, i want to give up, and i do not want to exist any more. The world knows I am a worthless piece if shit why can not you.Maybe I am not the smartest, neither the funniest, the bravest or the nicest. Maybe I am not the most handsome, the tallest, but i deserve to die finally. Like what, you expected someone not good does not  deserve anything? Give me death it will be enoughI do not quite know why this hit me so hard. Two days ago, I was drawing and out of nowhere burst into tears. It was 1:30 in the morning, and it was just me awake. I was not listening to sad music, nothing thag could have started it. I just remember rushing to close my sketchbook, turning in to the wall, and sobbing.\\n\\nThe real kicker was today. Turns out, like the idiot I am, I forgot I was taking a course and susbequently had 4 weeks\\' worth of schoolwork to make up. One of my teachers emailed me about this, of course. I gave a generic stress mixed with technology errors (I was not seeing any assignments in that course showing up, which was true), and crawled under the bed to cry. Because I am that pathetic and cowardly.\\n\\nI have not told my parents out of fear that I will lose tech privileges, but it is an overwhelming amount of work and I do not know if I have the will to make it all back up. People say when you hit rock bottom, there is nowhere to go but up. I say that they forget where the devil lives. (Watch everyone ignore this post, lmao)I need to stop but I have no idea how. it is putting strain on everyone and everything around me. I need to stop. How do I do that?At least for me. I can not speak for everyone but I feel no joy. No sadness. Nothing. It really destroys me because I want to feel something but nothing works.This sub fucking sucks. Life fucking sucks. I posted so many times on this sub with no avail. The truth is no one cares. No one ever cares. Until you start throwing tantrums in a failed attempt to gain attention. Only then will people judge you and tell you off. I fucking hate life. Just wanted to let anyone to know. But, we all know this post will be buried. Just like all of us into the ground. it is all meaningless. Nothing matters. No one cares.I honestly hope everyone is well and avoid NickelbackI wake up feeling like my stomach is trying to digest sand just churning and churning I also keep zoning out and only thinking about bad things such as suicide or other issues in like I am also so stressed I feel like I could pass out at any second but at the same time I get woken up by the anxiety and guilt.I find that over time the more unhappy I started hating people thinking of them as losers and scum. \\n \\nIs this normal thing or am I just asshole?Just visited my apartment. have not been there for a month. My plants are dead. My books fell from the shelve. Everything is dusty and my winter coats are still hanging near the door. I do not want to be here, I do not want to go back, no place feels like home, never did. I am sick of not being able to belong anywhere.I was starting to get better and manage my anxiety and depression but being sent into quarantine ripped away my only comfort. I was working to be able to hold myself up but I was still in the process of needing someone to help. \\nI had to move from my college appartement due to the virus with my BF and I have not been able to see him in a month and I am falling back into a hole hard. \\n\\nI have started considering self harm, again after being clean for months. Every night I have been crying. Little things set me off into a spiral of self hatred. I feel so hopeless and alone. \\n\\nI feel absolute resentment for his mother. Who will let him go to the store and expose himself to the virus but not come visit me 10 minutes away. \\n\\nTalking on the phone does not do anything and I am so tired of people saying “just talk on the phone, just face time” that makes it WORSE! I need physical touch and smell. Without that it just feels wrong and I am reminded that I can not see him. That I had to miss his 21st birthday, that we are going to miss out 3 YEAR anniversary and my 20th birthday. \\n\\nI can not get stuff done. I have so many online lectures building up and assignments and I have no motivation to do them. what is the point? Who knows if I will even make it through quarantine because it likely will just keep getting extended. Suicidal thoughts keep creeping into my head along with feelings of absolute defeat. I can not stand being at home with my broken family. I just want to stop being in the middle of my parents. I just want peace.32M here with not much to say about my life. \\n\\nI never had a date or a girlfriend, at the end of the day that is what crushes me the most, everything I do, I do alone and it is just empty when I have no one to share things with. I can not even imagine what it feels like to be with someone you genuinely like. \\n\\nI followed the advice of using the time to do something with myself. we are not born with equal capabilities, I am fit but I work a basic job and failed at getting an education. I wrote a lot but the end result is still quite garbage. I look at 32 years of life with nothing of value achieved. Neither professionally, nor socially, nor artistically.\\n\\nAnd at the end of the road, a lonely life is not worth living. I do not have much hope for things to change in such a short time, but at least I will now my best years are over and they were not worth it, so I am not missing out by leaving sooner. \\n\\nI just needed to say it somewhere.Anyone else? I am 30 and currently in the worst mental state of my entire life. I have battled depression for 17 years, but nothing akin to this. These past few days are the first time in my life I have seriously considered ending my life. In the past I could always say I had thought about suicide, but it was never an imminent threat to my life. \\n\\nNostalgia seems to be both a catalyst and a symptom of my depression. I can not stop thinking about my old life when i actually felt happiness. Playing outside with my friends, riding bikes, jumping on the trampoline. Just how connected we all were every day, everything felt so real. I can not stop my mind from constantly reminiscing on what my life once was, and the emptiness it is now. \\n\\nI never thought I would be someone who would post something like this. I suppose it is the overwhelming hopelessness I feel. I am afraid of myself for the first time ever, the depression has completely engulfed my being. A healthy way out feels impossible...I want out. I want to get away. I want to move so bad. Like today.\\n\\nI hate living where I live. I miss my car. I miss sleeping in my car.\\n\\nI want to move so bad. I want to get away from this apartment. \\n\\nI just want a new place. I am on a month to month. I just want a year lease.\\n\\n\\nMatter of fact, why can not I get a nice place, under 1.3k? No I take that back, I can easily find a place cheap, but no one will let me get credit pass.\\n\\n\\nAll I want is a year lease on someplace with a nice kitchen, decent backslash, clean carpet maybe two bedrooms. \\n\\nNope, I can not pass a credit check for my life.\\n\\nOH and why do people turn their nose at my VA disability? Like yeah I do not work, and I will probably be in the house all day everyday.\\n\\nBut as long as your paid, should that matter?\\n\\n\\n\\nNope, sorry we could not approve your application.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIKE BRO, I was paying 2.3k a MONTH just to sleep in a extended stay for a damn YEAR. Not by choice...2017/2018 ROUGH.\\n\\n\\n45$ fee every appointment just to write some info on piece of paper and I am trying to tell these people ahead of time...HEY I have bad credit from when I was young and dumb in the military.  But no, take this fee and deny me.\\n\\n\\nI hate this apartment, but I was homeless at the time, and they said yes. Honestly they said NO, but the people at the Veterans Center got me in there. Nonetheless it was better than the streets.\\n\\n\\nBeing a social outcast I have no references, err... I mean friends. \\n\\nNo one to hook me up. \\n\\nI remember this one couple that looked at my VA verification letter like it was a fake... I am like I drove here with disabled veteran plates, my ID says veteran, the freaking paper has a way to contact for proof...\\n\\n\\nI have apartment hunting trama from the level of pain and rejection I have felt. \\n\\n\\nI wanted to run away to Puerto Rico. Well... I thought that would be cool but ya know...lockdown ect, but I do not even know Spanish so...yeah doubt that move.\\n\\n\\nI am in abq, and all I want to do is find a NICE place to stay, I will pay whatever (under 1.5k)\\nRealistically, idk I would rather live in a rented uhual then this place... \\n\\n\\nIdk, might be some errors and spelling or even format but I do not care... I seriously hate my position in life right now, and could careless if this seems legible or not...\\n\\nI want to move.but i lost myself somewhere here. I am listening to nickelback and that is the worst this anyone can do.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VRj2uw9L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VRj2uw9L0) got to be someone right? I do hope everyone is okI always thought I preferred being alone, but this isolation has me stuck with myself 24/7 and its breeding a whole new level of self hatred and self sabotage. I keep causing fights with my girlfriend, putting off the work I know I have to be doing, and making excuses for being a waste of space. I have no motivation to get anything done. I just want to lay in bed all day and sleep. it is been a while since I have been here, but at the moment dreams or even a dreamless sleep is significantly better than the reality of facing myself and my problems day in and day out.And honestly I do not even feel like it. I hate everything about myself and maybe I can finally lose some weight. Being stuck in my room all day is just making my depression worse. I keep getting panic attacks that I can not control. My life just feels so off idk. I have this emptiness inside that nothing fills. My one friend is gone. I am alone and I hate it.I told my therapist and my psychiatrist about how suicidal I am and they kinda brushed it off like \"you are not the only one smh\" attitude.\\nI was put on antipsychotics by my paychiatrist for my shit fck MDD\\nLife is a wreck. Quarter life crisis started with this virus thing.\\nI remembered when I was a kid I would imagine life in 2020 be successful and be making big bucks.\\nYea right, getting fcked by corporations that look at us like some numbers on the board, playing Russian roulette, like who is going to die next and bring in the next unemployed guy named Shawn to replace me\\nMy mind is all over the place rn, I will be fcked if I take my antipsychotics and I will be fcked if I do not\\nEither ways life is meaningless, we do not have no fcking purpose. Wake up people\\nFlu or no flu, we are fcked\\nHistory of humanity proves itselfI am so ashamed of myself but I lost it. I lost my mind. I saw red. And all I could think was fuck everything and fuck everyone. \\n\\nMy best friend suffered a tragedy beyond words in December. The father of her unborn child and her partner hung himself. She was 8 months pregnant and found him in their brand new house, had to take him down and give him\\nCPR While he died in her arms. it is been traumatizing. I have had conversations with her that have been more heartbreaking than most things I have heard in life. \\n\\nEaster Sunday we are all having a great morning and my sister brings up that she would like to give my friend at $250 target gift card to help. My dad out of nowhere says “$250? that is some bullshit.” Everyone was stunned. no one said anything until I spoke up and said “why is that bullshit? To help my best friend whose struggling really bad right now and is so depressed and sick that she is on short term disability bc she is not ready to go back to work. Then to save face in front of everyone, he started to lie. Just straight lie and act like he had no idea who jasmine was (he is met her several times she is been my friend for over a decade) tried to act like he had no idea about the situation (completely lies. He knew everything about it. He was there when I went to the funeral and asked a bunch of questions and I cancelled a lot of things during this time to support her) and made me look like a crazy person for being upset.\\n\\nMind you- my dad and I have had a strained relationship for awhile. My husband and I have been living in my parents basement for a year to try to save and he has made servers really fucked up comments besides this one- called me a fucking asshole bc I questioned something he said Under his breath about me and yelled a berated me in front of my husband. Has been rude to my husband. Made snide remark after snide remark to the point where I am completely anxious to even do upstairs or be around him bc he is just mean. \\n\\nMy mom and I have always been close. She did not say anything to him during this incident. And basically said to me after I got upset “shut up. I am trying to enjoy my Easter.” Okay yeah bc I was not trying to enjoy my Easter right ? This morning I made an order at a wine store and she went off on me telling me that I have not asked her if she is wanted anything from any stores when we have gone out and basically calling us selfish. Let me be clear- I am about the least selfish person ever. And I forgot to ask 1 time. We have been out of the house maybe 5-6 times total and I sent her screen shots when I and my husband have asked her if she needed anything. I just could not believe she has the nerve to call me selfish after all this had gone down and I have not heard a word from her or my dad about Sunday. No apologies. Nothing. \\n\\nSo I lost it. Everything came to a head. I am in so much pain and have been for over a decade. I take meds daily. I see my psych and therapist regularly. I try so hard to better myself and be a good person, daughter, sister, wife everything and everyone just seems to want to shit on me. I just do not know anymore. I do not know what I ever did to deserve this. I feel like I was born by mistake. My sisters never get shit. Literally never. My oldest sister can basically do no wrong- yet I am supposed to be having a wedding in 5 months and she has not done a damn thing or asked anything about it and she is supposedly one of my maid of honors. \\n\\nI first took 6 of my pills and then cut my arm with my razor. Not too deep and not too near my veins. I am so ashamed of myself. it is been a really really long time since I have done that. The pain I felt. Watching it bleed. It just made me\\nWant to keep going and brought back all\\nThe trauma I have had in my life. All the pain I stuff down every day and have for years. I am in so much pain and still no one cares. I am just the brunt of everyone’s bullshit. And all I can think about it wanting to end it all. I love my husband so much and my two cats but the pain is so deep that sometimes I do not even think about how their lives would be effected if I died. And he does not understand. He does not understand the pain. \\n\\nI have bandaged my arm. 6 pills were not enough to do anything but make me really tired and numb to my emotions- I did email my doctor. \\n\\nI do not know where to go from here. I just need a hug. I need someone to tell me that I am not crazy and that I have a right to be upset and feel hurt. My feelings do matter. That my life is important. I tried to text my mom that I wanted to die and she basically got more mad at me and gave me an ultimatum to talk or not and then continued to say I was ridiculous for wanting to die bc she got mad at me about the grocery order. She knows good and well that was just the straw that broke the camels back in my current depression. \\n\\nSorry for the ramble. I just needed to vent. I needed someone out there to here me. Someone to let me know it will be okay. \\n\\nTLDR: I self harmed for the first time in over 14 years and am ashamed of myself.Today i was trying to make some bucks but just when i was about to start doing something i felt sad and discouraged. Imagine how awful it is to be hungry and want to eat, just for your body to run away from getting food and instead go and stay in a corner doing nothing. I can not do this by myself anymore. I need help but no one can give it to me because i am a legit burden and people do not deserve to deal with my shit. do not talk me out of this, it is not going to work. When you see an abandoned kitten in the street you know you will not do shit if you just pet him. Instead you take him home and help him to flourish. I hate to admit it but i am so hopeless as that and altho i internaly cringe at the idea, i know it is the truth.\\n\\nI will never be worth anything ever. I am damaged and if i do a recovery of sorts, i will carry the scars of this forever.19 in my second year of college, although I have only passed one semester of the four I have taken and had to withdraw from the rest. Went to the doctor after my first year here and they told me I had Severe Seasonal depression. It seemed to only affect me during the winter, but this year it seems like its still hanging on, and I have lost all motivation. I walked out of my job of 2 years, stopped pursuing hobbies I have loved since middle school, and now will be my last semester in college before I have no choice but to drop out (Lost all financial aid and can not afford). I am currently on 20mg Fluoxetine (10 was not enough) and I am starting to feel completely worthless. The only thing I have going for me is that I still live with my mom, but all i can find happiness in doing is playing video games. Even with the current events and circumstances, I can not make myself get out of bed to work on online homework. I struggle everyday of my life to find motivation to do anything, and I do not know what to do anymore. Starting to feel like nobody needs me here. If you have any advice on what keeps you motivated and what makes you get out of bed everyday, please share. Thanks for reading if you made it to the end.&#x200B;\\n\\n1.

Send help pls.I am always in the constant reminder that how much would it be better if i got into an accident and died. I always fantasize about dying. Honestly i do not even care if i die of the coronavirus bc i do not want to live in this fucking world. I would be more than happy to die. The only reason I am alive is because of my family. I know how much it would hurt them when they find out I am dead. If only i could erase myself from everyone\\'s memory then i would be able to die without any regrets.I woke up just 20 minutes ago... it is 1:49pm... I feel like a jobless fat piece of shit. My lack of motivation caused me to gain 50+ pounds... i get stupidly upset when I find porn on my bfs computer and than after I get done crying I realize how fucking stupid I am acting and than I get pissed at myself smoke a cigarette and procrastinate when it comes to looking for a job. I know that I am not helping myself but I just feel like I really do not give a fuck if I sink in life or not I already want to kill myself . Usually I am pretty keyed up and emotional but today I feel nothing but anger and nothing at the same time. I am kinda a hypocrite, I lie and I feel like a bad person.. I feel like if there was a heaven or hell I would definitely be going to hell at this point I have no one in my life and my boyfriend and his family are the only ones that care about me but they do not even know he is my boyfriend lol we have kept it a fucking secret for 2 years and honestly idk how to feel about that... my life is a mess and I am only 18 at this point I survive on weed cigarettes tea diet pills and sleep I really want to die but like all of me and my fellow pussies I am kinda scared....if you can not tell I am balls deep in my depression. I cut almost all my hair off the other day with scissors (short like a pixie) and I feel like I am really ugly but people tell me I am very pretty and all it does is piss me off because I feel like I am disgusting... I am a sex addict. I am pretty sure I deal with a lot of shit for someone who is only an 18 year old girl but that would take a novel just to explain. I feel like everything I have to deal with on a daily basis has driven me to insanity I used to be pretty happy but when I turned 16 I was moved from house to house for 2 years and counting. I am a piece of shit haha and honestly I feel like if I was to lose the weight get a job and have my own apartment I would feel good again... but right now that seems like fantasy land for me well idk where I was even going with this but yeah that is me :lMoments of joy are cut short by it, the sudden boosts of confidence and hope do not come around often anymore. If they come, they last a breath. My overthinking has become a huge problem, so instead of savoring moments I let them pass by because my mind is occupied with many thoughts, some of which will never happen. It makes me sleep bad if it let us me sleep at all. I wake up mad because I am alive, knowing the privilege but more than willing to pass it onto someone else.Birthday is the worst day of my life. Every birthday I am reminded that I do not matter much in anyone\\'s life.\\nToday was my 19th birthday. Those of my friends who I thought would wish me in the first place, did not even remember the date. And others who wished knew only because I had told them quite recently.  \\nThough it is not the first time I have felt extremely alone, even then I feel sad. Maybe it is my fault too, to expect so much of a birthday wish from others. I kept checking my phone after every 2 minutes if anyone had even got a facebook reminder. \\n\\nI just do not understand why am I different from others. Other people get wished even weeks before their bday. What would they lose in just remembering a date, 15 April.\\nWhy is it that I do not get the same amount of happiness as others get. I have never even hurt anyone. \\nI know this is not the last time I have felt like a loser. I will get the same feeling sometime later again. \\n\\nI just do not want to get reminded the same fact again and again.Hi I did not know where else to go my gf suffers from depression and is going getting help. she is going to a mental hospital/clinic idk how to call it. I am happy she is getting help but it is hard for me not being able to help her I know there is no way I can help her or understand but it still hurt. She leaves in a couple days to stay in the hospital for a month and it is difficult I feel like she feels alone and that I am mad at her for going I am not it is just hard to be separated from her for so long. she is my best friend and I want her to get help. Is there anything I can do to let her know I support her in her decision to get help even if I am sad at the same time?I hate Trump...but I agree with him that we should open up the country. I need to make my life better and I am growing bitter and angry at seeing people laughing and posting their dumb photos and fake concerns. I do not care anymore-why should I care for a country...a society that sees me as a loser? Why should I care for a country that ignores me? Either way, global warming will still end humanity us all so we might as well get on with it. Sick and tired of people posting these cheery fake videos of qUAreNTinED and having a “hard” time inside their fucking houses. I get why people voted Trump-they want it to all burn. I am jealous and hateful of everyone and everything and there is no hope for me. I can never be normal.I have a wife and 2 small kids, and I regularly on a daily basis want nothing to do with them.\\n\\nI do not want to play or interact with the kids. I just do not care. I want to care... but my brain does not care.\\n\\nI do not care about my wife anymore. The love I had when marrying her is long gone.\\n\\nI do not want to do the enormous pile of dish washer loading and unloading 4 times a day because she keeps eating and never cleaning up afterwards.\\n\\nI do not want to empty and hang up clothes and load the washer twice a day because they keep making a mess.\\n\\nWhat I want is to either be totally separated from them and just pay the child support for 18 years, and completely independent and on my own.\\n\\nI miss the days where I could wake up on a day off whenever the fuck I wanted to. I could game for hours on end and have fun with buddies online.\\n\\nI used to go out to bars with work buddies or my entire work department and have a great time after a week of work, chat up the ladies, just enjoy life.\\n\\nI fucking hate being at home. I look forward to work every single day now. I would rather be there working and away from my family.\\n\\nBut on the flip side.. I feel an insane amount of guilt and anger with myself for feeling like this. It would be a lot easier to just fucking kill myself.\\n\\nI most of the time rather be dead than do the separation option because Its selfish and awful of any man to do that to someone and still be alive living their life while the ex wife does all the heavy lifting alone knowing that her partner just up and left and did not give a shit.\\n\\nAt least if I am dead she can take out her anger on the fact that at least I am dead and not out there living, which would make her feel worse.\\n\\nI am so fucking tired... tired of the hallucinations, the meds that do not work, regularly overdosing my meds trying to get them to work cos I can not see a shrink anymore thanks to covid, waking up feeling like I have been bashed in the face with a hammer every day while my daughter is yanking my arm to get up and do boring shit like play with fucking toys I could not give 2 shits about, watching crappy cartoons on repeat, making her food and then she barely eats any of it so what is the fucking point, all while trying to stand up with a head that feels like it is been blown off.\\n\\nI am tired of everyone. I am tired of my dickhole parents always trying to keep in contact when I have made it clear I do not want to know them anymore. I am tired of hearing that the distant family members are sending me messages to say hi when I have not spoken to them for years since they traumatised me and fucked me over.\\n\\nI am tired of trying to get in touch with another friend who regularly thinks of ending his life and trying to calm him down, tired of trying to keep in touch with childhood buddies who just up and abandoned talking to me when I moved.\\n\\nFUCKING TIRED. I just want to live like Jimmy in the Wire. Shithole apartment with one room and a mattress on the floor and my smartphone and maybe a TV. Bag of clothes in the corner. Eat when I am out. Drink lots. Smoke weed or do some drugs. Go to titty bars, and if I can not do that.... fuck it, I am jumping. Everyone in the world... humanity... go fuck yourself.\\n\\nShit species. Always consuming and multiplying and spreading everywhere when there is nothing left to consume. Just like a fucking virus. Fuck humanity.I swear I just do not know anymore. Y do I feel like this? So lost so empty. Y me? How come everyone who I look at just seems to be living better then me? I feel stuck between the world with no escape. I want to die but do not want to kill my self. Please can I go to sleep a never wake up PLEASE I do not feel like I belong in this world. Everything about screams I should not be here. How did I get to this? This point of no faith. No matter what I try it just seems as there is no luck for me. Y should I keep fighting when there no end to this war this pain I am so tired I just want to sleep. Is that too much to ask for? I hate it here. I hate my self I hate the world I hate how unfair my life has been while I see others who just look as god has touched them. Do I have a purpose? Maybe my purpose is to die maybe that is the answer maybe it is all I have been looking for. The answer to my peaceI am genuinely scared of what is going to happen next because everything has gone so wrong.\\n\\nFirst, I live in New York, and my town got infected way before many other places\\n\\nNext, online school is super difficult for me because of my depression anxiety and add (diagnosed btw). I am in eighth grade so it should not be that big of a deal even if I failed, but I am taking 3 highschool courses and I might have to retake all of them next year, and I am fucking freaking out.\\n\\nI am also stuck in the house with my parents who will never get off my back.\\n\\nAnd to top it all off, my best friend says she does not know if she wants to be friends anymore and nothing even feels real.\\n\\nSometimes I just like to say that everyone\\'s just pulling a big prank on me and everything is okay. it is really the only thing that would calm me down. I really hope this stuff will make me delusional or insane so I do not have to deal with this anymore.my grandma passed away, my depression and eating disorder just increased significantly, really trying hard to find the will to live. my SO and I are not on good terms as of this moment. I am feeling for the people who are struggling at this moment and i feel helpless and hopeless that there is not something i could do about it. I numbed everything in me but it is slowly building up. i wish i had drugs on hand to numb the pain. even for a slight second.No matter how much i try to feel positive, try to distract my self i just can not get better. I cry all the time, i become angry at small things. I just want to die i will never get better never fuck my life plz kill me plz I feel like a loser i can not sleep  i can not function like a normal human. The only thing i do is just cry cry cry and cry I am sick of living this pathetic life i hope i die soonEveryday of this journey is painful and hard, ot makes me more than tired and i do not know what to do to get out of it. BUT, everyday, i have this moment of the day where nothing matters, the night falls and everything seems cool, all the stuffs i was fearing about during the day just seems to fly out and I can just smile and talk to people. \\n\\nJust wanted to know if anyone else experiences this or smthing close to it !\\n\\nI KNOW WE WILL OVERCOME THIS, BYEI have been using the betterhelp app for the past week and had a session scheduled for today but I could not afford to pay for another week so now I can not talk to her. I have not had a therapist in almost a year amd I desperately need someone to talk to. I have just been crying and drinking all morning.So tired I just want to cry. I try to keep myself from falling throughout the day. One may see me as prolly the strongest person in a work environment. But after it is over, I just want to break down. So tired. what is the point of working anymore. I once thought it was to fullfil my desire to do what I love. Now it is just child\\'s play for a handsome paycheck. it is meaningless. I am just so lonely. Work, study, lift, eat, sleep. I just wish I had someone. So hard. so sadWhat am I even doing anymore? Why am I still here? I never belonged here. Some people are not meant for life. I tried for a good while, it just was was not enough. I think I am done. I am not even in control of myself anymore. If I do this, it will be me taking control. I will be making a decision I want to make. The darkness will not hold me back anymore. Maybe I will catch a glimpse of myself before I go. I have not seen him in so long. I do not know what he looks like anymore. I have scarred and mutilated my body and my mind. I am tired of doing this to myself. I am tired of fighting. I am tired and I think I am ready to move on. \\n\\nI do not know what else to do.\\nI am so tired\\nI just want to rest\\n\\nI will just go to sleep and everything will be okay, right?\\n\\nThis is me reaching out I guess. Looking for a reason to keep fighting, to keep going. Give me a reason please. I do not want to die, I just can not live like this anymore.I am in Ontario. I know location does not matter too much. I am also considered an essential service. I do laptop repair for a major manufacturer. We support many other essential workers, so we are more backline, out of sight workers. Still essential.\\n\\nI am also an introvert. I do okay in large groups, but I prefer gatherings of less than 10. Even that has been taken away. I can not do my regular dinners with my mom, or my sister. My dad was not able to visit for Easter. I am just stuck at work, or stuck in the damn house and I am getting sick of it. I have had depression as long as I remember, I was diagnosed last year. I was doing so well. I have never done any type of visible self harm, though I have had addictions. Suicidal thoughts were a normal occurrence in my life, though I never made any attempts at my own life.\\n\\nI was starting to get so much better. I was taking my medication. Thoughts of ending my life were not as prevalent in my mind. I was enjoying life. Enjoying spending time with loved ones. My wife and new son. Now I dread every moment. I am worn out and there is no way for me to recharge. I hardly sleep. I am at my breaking point and if something does not change I am afraid of what I might do. Self harm is off the table but for how long? How much longer can I go on like this?\\n\\nthere is not really any point to this post. I just need to air out my thoughts somewhere anonymous.When I see people suffer, I feel pain too. Even in the very serious pandemic right now, how can some people do not care and  being ignorance to the suffers? How can they keep enjoy life when terrible thing happening from the outside world?i do not like myself. i do not like the way i have lived my life. i do not like how I have treated others. i feel like i have lived a life of lies. just want to disintegrate. \\n\\nI do not like myself as a person and I do not want to make myself better.***Really long I know. Sorry about that.\\n\\nI have always been an optimist, all my life I have always tried to look for the bright side of things. And it is the same way now, sometimes I convince myself. But then there is days like these where everything comes crashing down, and I remember how I was bullied by everyone. And how I always felt like shit, I remember all the \"friends\" I used to have that would call me ugly and ignore everything I did, and just laughed at my face. I remember my ex and the abuse I went from her and how no one supported me, ever.\\n\\nBut I do not want to be depressed, I know I sound like an asshole but I think suicide is about the dumbest thing you can ever commit. Why kill yourself when your already going to die? Why not live life to the fullest and let death come naturally? \\n\\nBut even though I have those thoughts there is always that other voice in my head. A voice that you can barely hear, you would have to really listen to be able to hear it. It keeps telling me to kill myself over and over again it says, what is the point in being alive when no one likes you, when all your friends hate you. Your a nobody, stop being alive.\\n\\nOn most days I can barely hear the voice I ignore it, but then there is those days where I wake up and cry and it is like the voice had climbed over the thousands of walls I have put up and its shot the thousands of little guards that I call rational thought. And it is THERE, it is taken over everything.\\n\\nBut I am still a little strong I can pin that thought down and throw it back to the back of my mind. But it is words still haunt me.\\n\\nSo yeah I do not know if I am depressed, I do not want to be depressed, I was scared to post on this subreddit because other depressed people scare me. They really do, talks about suicide scare me. Like a real talk on it, the nitty gritty of suicide, cutting, tying a noose all that. It scares me.\\n\\nMaybe it is because every time I open this subreddit I am looking at who I really am.I am sad. Sad is me. \\n\\nAm I the only one that feels like this life in all aspects is turning to complete shit before our eyes? \\n\\nEverywhere you look life is shit. And nobody seems to care. I feel like dying. How can I die? \\n\\nit is just going to get more and more fucked up. I have no hope for anything any more. \\n\\nWhat can I do to be happy? How do happy people do it? I guess they have a life. That must help. Stuff like an SO and friends probably helps keep you sane. I do not have that.\\n\\nI am alone and I have been alone. Every time I try to not be alone I seem to just make it worse. Nobody calls. Nobody texts. Nobody wants to know me. \\n\\nThey do not want to be with a depressed person. Nobody likes depressed people. We should all just die. I should die. The non depressed people would have easier lives without me around trying to sponge their happiness.\\n\\nHow can I die? I wish I knew some easy way. I really want it. I have wanted that for years. Decades. But I do not know what to do. it is one thing to think but another to actually do.\\n\\nI know it just gets worse. Constantly. More and more people turn out to be assholes. More tragic awfulness in the world seems destined. Nobody cares about anyone or anything anymore.Well, I never really *stopped* harming myself.\\n\\nI used to cut my wrists and thighs, but I stopped doing that four or five years ago. Until today.\\n\\nWhen I stopped cutting, I did other things. I hit myself, scratched myself, burned myself. I always had to have something. I get these attacks of blind rage where I just have to hurt *something*, but I do not want to hurt other people, so I usually end up hurting myself. When I do, I feel sort of satisfied with it. I am not as angry anymore.\\n\\nI used to have a pretty bad problem with cutting which is why I stopped for so long, but today, other methods of hurting myself just was not working.\\n\\nI want help. I really do. I do not want to live out the rest of my life hurting myself and contemplating suicide nearly every day. There are just so many more lows than there are highs for me. But there is nothing I can do. I clearly can not help myself. it is been eight years of genuinely trying to get better, to no avail.\\n\\nBut I can not get help. either. My insurance does not cover therapy. The only therapist I could see would be the one on my college campus, but with the pandemic and summer coming up, that is out of the question now.\\n\\nI have really thought about admitting myself to a mental hospital because I am scared that one day, I will go too far. I do not think rationally when I want to hurt myself. there is one nearby that I have looked into, but again, my insurance would not cover it, and neither I or my family have that kind of money.\\n\\nI feel hopeless. Angry, scared, and hopeless.~~We ran away~~  He kicked us out a decade ago, when I was 9, after witnessing horrible acts of physical, sexual and emotional abuse by his hands both to my mom and me (not sexual, that happened at the hands of other family members later)  for many years, pretty much since I was born.\\n\\nYet my mom and the rest of my family have always forced me to act like she was my saviour. No one likes it when I as much as try to bring up the fact that she was the one who cheated on him, she was the one who regularly left me alone with him, knowing full well he was making my life living hell.\\n\\nWhen we left, that should have been the end of the pain. Not the ramp up; the part where the guitars start properly chugging and the LPFs are released.\\n\\nAnd then she left. I was barely 13. She left to move to another city, because she wanted to live her life unbound by me. She wanted to date rich European men and hoe around. And that came at the cost of me being forced to spend the next 5-6 years of my life with my piece of shit paternal grandparents. Those who made clear that I was just a burden left on them unjustly.\\n\\nAll of this is a tiny, tiny, tiny part of my story, but it bears mentioning/ranting. I still fantasise about ripping and tearing my dad, sure, but no matter what I still have nothing but resentment for my mom. And considering I will never be in a romantic relationship (not by choice), therapy and medication simply never worked for me in the 5 years I did try it, and emotionally fulfilling friendships over the web only go so far... there is really nothing left. Is there?\\n\\nMaybe I am the real villain here, and I just need to shut up. My suicide note will probably not even mention any of this considering how much more it hurts that I will never ever have anyone who will love me. who will show me what love is like when no one else did. do not you dare tell me to love myself do not you fucking dare.It all started with someone homophobic, my friend shipped me with him and I am gay so.. Anyways, she went apeshit about how it was my fault and how i was screaming over it even though i was just getting    \\nsuper angry, so then he gets mad and now i have 2 mad at me, fast forward its 4 now because I am starting to get meaner, i calm down and 2 like me again, then BAM one day i made a joke about myself and someone comments a horribly rude comment on it, then it starts this whole thing and now only 2 people like me, my sister and my best friend. how do i stop this. how do i gain their trust again.. Someone help, i feel like starving myself and cutting.I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they are not physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I am in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I am 6\\'2\", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I am so fucking depressed.\\nI told my parents that I have not been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.\\nI only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.\\nI drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I am actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.\\n\\nPlease if you are not actually depressed do not say you are it is people like that that make me not come forward and people that do not recognize depression as a real conditionBiocitalopram or something. Lockdown means I can not get more currently so just yeah.I do it because I absolutely hate discussing my feelings.  It takes too much emotional effortEvery fucking self help bullshit starts with \"Just stop saying self talk and just start self affirming yourself.\" \\n\\nIt all amounts to \"Just do not have all the issues you have, and instead have no issues!\"\\n\\nWow thanks I am cured, it was that easy all a fucking long. Thanks. Why did not I think of that???????????I just do not know how to bring it up. Thanks for any advice.I am just kind of venting here but I am also curious to see if anyone can relate.\\n\\nthere is this friend that I have that I talk to quite often online through discord, and we are pretty close. But I always dread talking to her because of how she treats me. it is near impossible to get my point across on anything without her interrupting or changing the subject. Whenever I say something to intend one thing, she will take it as another thing (if that makes sense) and she will usually try to always one-up me in our conversations. Last night she talked about a little of what she struggles with, and I was there for her to comfort/support her. But when I tried to bring up myself and open myself to her, she ignored me and shot it down. She does say she hopes I can find peace or whatever, but she will not ever allow me to be myself with her (which would be really helpful) and when she talks to me, it is like she completely ignores what I tired to say. She can not ever seem to understand me when I try to talk to her, and I really want her to. And I **always** feel worse after every conversation we have.\\n\\nBut can any of you guys relate? Like you try your best to explain your situation to someone, and they say they are sorry or they get it. But when they try to help or give advice, it is in a completely different direction.\\n\\nOr something like this.Just slowly going to sleep and never waking upHey guys, I am need someone to talk my life is so bad i do not want anymore..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nif you want to talk with me discord :  drmedwurst275**#2184** \\n\\nENG or DE only if possible..So I would like to mark that English is not my first language. Thank you for understanding if you spot any grammar or other mistakes like that. Trigger warning: bullying, toxic relationship.\\n\\n\\\\----------------------\\n\\nI just do not want to live. No one understands that, everyone keeps telling me shit that my life is just about to start. Like saying that my problems maybe does not matter because I am young (18). I am scared that life may be even worse than today. I have been suffering from depression for a really long time (I stopped being happy when I was 4th grade, wanted to kill myself since 6th grade). Everyone in my primary school was bullying me and telling me stuff I am ugly, weird and sometimes they were throwing stuff at me. There was once a boy that kept kicking my legs but I do not remember exactly why. When I graduated from this school to another, the bullying just did not stop. They were bullying me because I was poor and my family had financial problems. When I moved to another town I had strong trust issues but everything was fine. I felt like everything is about to change to better.\\n\\nBut it did not.\\n\\nI found my first boyfriend when I was 15. We were with each other for almost 2 years. I felt loved and I would do then everything for him just to feel loved. I was very jealous of him. Something like yandere tbh but I do not think so, I just wanted to be with him forever and show everyone that I can be in relationship (I remember when one of girls from my class in primary school told me that I am so ugly and disgusting that even a pedophile would not touch me). So I did. Until he started insulting me in a very vulgar way but mostly he called me \"a fucking ameba\". He also started to be nice to me but only when we had sex. I could not satisfy him when I tried to pleasure him. He was also trying to flirt with my lesbian acquaintance. In front of me. Many times. I did not want to end this relationship because I thought that I will never find a partner again and I will be forever alone. But I finally decided after all this long time of pain. I told him to fuck off. I cried for a long time but for now I just feel disgusting that a person like him has touched my body. No worries, he never raped me nor molested me. I just feel bad that someone like him touched me.\\n\\nAfter some months I went to the mental hospital because I was feeling really suicidal. I have been here for about 3 weeks. People were bullying me there because I was annoying to them and one girl even told me that I should just kill myself and everyone will be happy. They were laughing at me because \"I could not handle the truth\". My mom took me out from there even though my doc wanted to keep me for two weeks more. Yes, she knew what was happening to me during my stay in this stupid hospital.\\n\\nWhen I was there someone from my classmate\\'s discord told me they can keep me company during this hard time. It was my future boyfriend. We were with each other for some months. He broke up with me because he felt that he has feels for a girl that he knew for a long time. I felt sad but he never hurt me, so I decided just to let him go. I did not want to be annoying or something.\\n\\nAnd now we are here. Me, depressed and bored, who does not want to get better because I know it will not work. It never worked. And this coronavirus stuff is making me even more depressed. I want to die but something from this virus just bugs me. I am just... lost, ugh. Everything pisses me off.Life just was not meant for me. I am unable to live up to the standards society has placed on me. As a 22 year old male, there is obviously a lot of them. Want examples? Ok. I am expected to be tough and never show emotions, can not do that. I am expected to know a lot about cars and tools and all that, I do not know any of that. In relationships, I am expected to “be a man” and provide for women, make all the first moves, chase after scary sounds and bugs, do heavy lifting, provide for her while she just gets to be comfortable, I definitely can not do any of that. I have never even been in a relationship, as someone with high functioning autism/aspergers, dating is pretty much rigged against me, so is society as a whole really. Women are cared about and have all these people fighting for them, I wish I had people fighting for me, I matter to nobody. Women are always cared about when depressed but males are just told to man up and deal with it. I have always wished I was a girl. If some of that sounds sexist I really do not care, it was not, and if that is how you took it that is too bad. I do not have the strength, mentally and emotionally to live up to these standards, never can, and I never plan to. Already planning to kill myself soon, I am beginning to overcome my fear of death and by the end of the year I likely will. Life clearly was not meant for me, and I do not plan to stick around, especially in a world that hates me. \\n\\nI know this is going to be ignored, but I do not give a shit at this point, I need I vent whether you all like it or not. It just proves my point about how I do not matter.I love and miss you guys, I wish the four of you wanted to talk to me again. I leave and end this world alone but free of pain of grief and sadness. I will never hold anger towards you like you feel towards me, I am glad I met you Z** and thank you for being a part of my life. I am sorry things have to end this way, I love you like my closest friends and hope you the best I am 19. I have been feeling depressed for long stretches at a time and every once in a while I will feel fine but I go back down seemingly out of nowhere and I am depressed for what feels like forever. I live with my parents and I do not like talking to them about my issues because they just tell me I am complaining. I do not have my own doctor and with this COVID it is not like I can go anywhere to seek help. I feel stuck and I do not want this anymoreSo I have been going to a therapist and a doctor for almost 1 1/2 years now and I feel like I have not made much progress aside from understanding myself better. On December my doctor prescribed Adderal to me for my depression and ADHD and it was pretty good in keeping me focused and being happy I guess. But I stopped taking it after like a week. I have not taken any medication or visited my therapist since. Mainly because I swore I was finally going to go back to college but never did. I was too ashamed to go back showing I had barely any progress. Plus I stopped taking medication. I know it would help me greatly but for some reason I just do not want to get into that funk of feeling good and I am not sure why. Is it because I simply am to attached to being depressed? It sucks because I feel like people that start therapy and all that start making noticeable changes in only a couple months and I have not done jack in almost two years. Like no progress and when the solution is right in my drawer(medication)  I do not want it. I just need a better understanding of all this.I have always felt like I take up more than I deserve. I have not eaten in 3 daya.\\n\\nI wish it did not feel so right. I take up so many resources and I can not work so why should I eat?Honestly at this point I am not living my life for me . I have excepted the fact I will never be truly happy . So I am just living my life to make others happy. Even if it hurts me . Feeling nothing is better then feeling this .I just can not anymore. Happiness is not real for me.Background: I am 25. I have had (diagnosed) anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. It was not triggered by anything bad in my life, stress, or negative attitude. It was sudden. it is been theorized by some doctors that it is due to one of the many concussions I have had over my lifetime. I have tried everything from behavioral therapy and therapy sessions to almost every class of antidepressant. Yes, exercising and eating healthy too, etc. I have settled on one medication that is been the best so far. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTherapy helped for a while, but I have not been able to find a replacement therapist that has helped. Therapy only helped me deal with the problems caused by my depression, not my depression itself.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt my best, I am a little anxious and somewhat normal, but never completely \"normal\". This is the case for 2 to 4 weeks. I then get a bout of depression that lasts 1 to 2 weeks. It is unprovoked and nothing seems to delay or prevent it, even regular exercise and healthy habits. I cannot stop it. My life is a cycle of several \"okay to good\" weeks followed by a couple of really low weeks. I tried self-medicating with marijuana for a while. It puts a damper on the tough weeks but does not help me continue living normally. I stopped using it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDoes anyone else suffer from a similar type of depression? I cannot tell if it is major, persistent, manic, or atypical, and I frankly do not care that much to label it. I just have never spoken to anyone with a similar pattern. Please let me know if you experience this too.I have come to the realization that I do not want to better myself if it involves teaching myself. I hate learning that way and it is not as effective as having a mentor or teacher present. \\n\\nI am in the marketing field and it is very \"never stop learning\" and \" you should be using the quarantine to create a new side hustle or get a new skill\". I have zero motivation to further my learning even when there is no quarantine. I want to move up in my career but without a teacher, mentor, or even someone else in my field that I can go to, it is near impossible. \\n\\nI literally need someone to walk me through things, which people might see as hand-holding. I am aware that people can not just walk me through life, but there is got to be some kind of solution\\n\\nI do not know anyone else who feels like this so is this normal? I WANT to want to learn, but straight up I do not want to learn a new skill. I know it will get me further in my career and my life, but I just can not bring myself to care.\\n\\nI am on antidepressants and they have worked wonders for me the past year, but I can not get past this hurdle. it is starting to affect my job and such. Any advice is appreciated!As someone who is depressed my opinion is that depression is just being repeatedly sad day after day due to lack of endorphines due to lack of anything for example if i suddenly met a girl (and I have never been in a relationship) that i liked i would get a natural release of endorphines causing me to feel good, do you think i would feel depressed at that moment? Then if that girl became my partner and i spent time with her every day i would get a release of endorphines so i would not be depressed at those times, enough endorphine released could keep you feeling stable or happy for a few hours without any activity(i think), is not it wrong for depression to be diagnosed and treated like a mental illness?I have been suffering from recurrent depression for years and have been seeing a therapist for about four months now, as I was no longer able to handle it myself. \\n\\nit is been bad before, but I think I have hit an all-time low  during the past weeks. Social and financial insecurity keep eating away at me, pressure from all sides to perform is crushing every will to go on, recent failures on search for jobs diminish every last bit of self-esteem and not being able to socialize during a damned pandemic takes away all my coping mechanisms. And finally, not having had a SO other to catch me for more than 7 years leaves me be lonely when times are toughest. Like that, I have been dragging myself from appointment to appointment with my therapist for the past weeks.\\n\\nYesterday, I burst into tears several times during the day, as I found myself reaching my limits. I wrote down all my thoughts and fealings to show my therapist today. \\n\\nAfter reading, he asked me if it would be possible that I would end up hurting myself, or possibly worse, in my current situation. \\n\\nI have been thinking about this before, but never with any intent. My pride would never allow me to take that step. Also, I value myself and my life way too much to consider suicide. I would rather have everything else go to shit and leave all things behind.\\n\\nHowever, being asked this question left me scared with the need to tell someone.My alters have been out way more recently and I am scared. I feel like like I am fading and I do not know what to do.Honorable grades through my high school, highest average grade at university\\'s first year (out of ~400ppl). Picked absolutely wrong major though, tried another one, did not work out too. Had absolutely no motivation, but finished first one (from best average grade to one of the worst on last semester), started msc in another field (IT).   Now I am 24 and feel like I am years behind my peers. Struggling to find a first professional job, missing deadlines all the time. From the person that usually did not give a fuck bcs felt like I can do anything if I want, to the person having suicidal thoughts. I am wrong perfectionist and it kills me and even does not let to accept possibility of failure. Everyone\\'s telling you get a good grades, go to good university, have a well paid job and live happy. Well its all nice and actually easy to live up to this standard until you realise that this kind of living is worth shit just before the end of the road. I am not that smart, more of hard-working type, and as I said, my life tailored me to be perfectionist who can not imagine failure, but I know I ended up pretty bad right now. I do not even know if I want to still pursue my actual field. Missing another recruitment deadline already bcs I am unable to get going because I am so tired of all the pressure,  need of catching up and skills improving all the time. I have been always more of artsy and sensitive type, tried alot of that stuff, but always stuck with \"real stuff\" in the end -came from the background of \"only hard work can make you a living\".  do not go that road ppl. Do what you feel, not what \"people say\". These feelings have been rising in me for the last 4 years, now I am drained and actually want to leave all of this including this world.\\n\\nFeel like I have absolutely wasted my like last 10 years on trying to be the best at something (what was not that hard to achieve), and realized it was all just for the confidence boost. I am basically nothing right now. Just sarcastic, bitter person at probably the best years of my life, feeling 10 years older already, and left with no power, nor resource to improve.It feels like I have been lying to myself. You know, one second you are sitting at home, happy for your college getting suspended for the longest time, and the next second you are empty for no reason. I have had the dark, depressing corners of my brain take hold of me many times in these past few months, but this is...worse. it is been long since I felt truly alone and hollow after being surrounded with absolutely everything I want. it is weird, I feel like my mind is retching and howling and all I have to show for it is an unenthusiastic face and drooping eyes. Got a laugh out of me. Still amuses me. I feel the eyes of my parents on me. they are the sweetest, and yet I can not help but think they are disgusted by me. they are not, I know they are not, and yet the only thing I felt today was a strong urge to apologise for existing.\\n\\nWell, fucked here or fucked there. At least I am at home without work to do. I thought things would get better if I was in a better place during the quarantine... Eh. Bring it on, world.I guess I finally have closure lol, this quarantine has really made me lose followers because I can not make content I am a 17 year old boy living in India and I am having a tough time living. A little background check - I am from an upper-middle class family, we live a decent life. The past 2 years have been very hard on me and I feel like 2020 is going to be even worse. I constantly fight with my parents for petty reasons and then I cry about it at night, I shout at them, and then regret it later. 2019 was a bad year, initially, till mid May, I was suicidal, I even put a blade to my wrist but somehow I stopped myself. I found a girl, the kindest, most beautiful girl ever, and I fell in love. But as the title suggests, I messed it up. I fell in love with her, she fell in love with me too, but I had a female friend with whom I was a little too flirtatious. Even though me and my girlfriend (who is also depressed and used to cut herself often and is now on medication) were not dating at that moment, I had the FUCKING audacity to talk the other girl as if I liked her. That made my girlfriend hurt herself. Me and my girlfriend, we were making out and immediately after that, I described a sex dream about the friend, WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT, I TOLD HER THAT I WOKE UP WITH A BONER???? Even after all this, my girlfriend stayed with me, and then she told me that she wants me to not talk to that friend BUT I SAID NO I WILL NOT STOP TALKING TO HER, AND I do not EVEN KNOW WHY I SAID NO. Then my girlfriend threatened to leave me if I did not stop to talking to her, and after realising that my sanity was at stake, I told her that I will stop talking to her, BUT HERE\\'S THE CATCH, I WAS STILL TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND did not TELL MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT. After she confronted me about it, I finally stopped talking to her, but I guess it was too late. We did not break-up, but she started bringing up breaking up with me frequently because of the way I treated her, she is right. I then, after realising how bad I fucked up, I started making amends, started trying to redeem myself but to no avail. Today, it has been 8 months since we started dating and one of her puppies died and I told her that I used to hurt myself because when she used to get mad and used to tell she would rather be with \"A guy she knows\" because he would not hurt her from the beginning, even though I swore never to hurt myself again. And now she does not want to be with me and also feels like killing herself because she hurt me, even though it is my fault and I should have told her earlier, she takes the blame on herself and does not want to be with me anymore. But I love her so much and she is the one person I am never going to give up on, no matter what she says, it is either her or nobody else, now I am not trying to be toxic or manipulate her into staying with me, but I really do not want her to go, the pain of separation is way too much for me to deal with. I am sitting in my room with my lights off, tears rolling down my cheeks listening to death bed by POWFU thinking she was probably better off without me. I do not think I can live anymore.So, i am new to reddit and i do not quite know how everything works yet, but i have been thinking about posting because i always read reddit about medications and depression/anxiety/bipolar to see others experiences and how they deal with them.\\n\\nI have never been properly diagnosed. Well, I have been to many different people and i have gotten many different diagnosises: major depression, bipolar, schizophrenic. So, i have a lot of confusion within myself with my situation and its quite frustrating. It would be helpful to know what is going on with me so i could deal with what i have going on as best as possible. \\n\\nI guess I am just ranting because i do not know i how to feel or what to do with anything i have going on. I feel so debilitated. On top of that i take medication, which is another annoying and confusing process within itself (having to figure what works for you and what dose works for you). I take Lamictal 400mg right now, but i do not know if that is too much because i feel like I am having some cognitive issues like forgetting what I am going to say mid sentence or have nothing to think of in general (very blank), but like i said very confusing because i do not know if its the medication doing that or the condition/mental illness that i deal with. Also, sexual dysfunction is THE WORST... I am 20 so this is a issue for me when it comes to medications. I never know how to feel about what I am taking and when it comes to medication i am very impatient and freak out at the beginning when i start to feel all of the intial side effects. When that happens I will self medicate and switch my dose by myself. I know this will not help anything, but I will have anxiety about it and just make a rash decision.\\n\\nSorry about the long post, but i feel like i do not have people that deal with similar issues to talk about this with. I feel like giving up a lot because i just do not know what to do anymore or how to fix myself or at least be a functional person. I have distanced myself from my friends and people i love and feel like I have ruined my relationship with my girlfriend because of the crazyness that i deal with and in turn put on other people.\\n\\nI am lost and do not know what to do... HOW DO YOU DEAL OR GET OUT OF THIS?????Hi,\\n\\nthis is very actually pretty fucking hard for me to talk about this and its not a good way to post it on the internet. But I have to stand my fear. My heart is beating really fast.\\n\\nSo when I mean basicly, the process was the same, but with clothes on...It was in somewhere 7th grade maybe a year later. So its like 6-8 years after it happend. He bullied me 24/7 and he is one of the reason why I have depression, social anxiety etc. I am not sure how long it was all I did was trying to kick against his shinbone. But it did not work, he just kept going. I just tried everything with my strength but I was too weak. After I do not know how long he let me go and we went back to class.\\n\\nI want to kill this guy actually so bad. I remember his fucking name and if my life will not go better or just trash, I swear I will kill him, then kill myself no joke actually.\\n\\nbtw I am a boy if that matters anything. \\n\\nI am not sure what the fuck to expect as an answer. I am not even sure anyone will. But I really need any answer to this. Like...i do not know say something. I will talk with my therapist about this tomorrow.it is very hard to explain, but I have been in a very fragile state the last year or two, and I feel like I am finally opening my eyes for the first time. Due to some unfortunate traumatic events, I was taught at a very young age that anyone you trust can betray you and ruin your life, but somewhere along the lines, I still adapted a rather selfless personality (That is not self-flattery). \\n\\nI have a serious problem with putting people before myself. Not so much doing favors and sacrificing my own, letting them walk all over me, but I invest all of my time thinking about my friends, partners, and family, alongside all their issues. I am well aware that their problems are not mine to take on, but I overthink them regardless. Same applies to my own issues, but it is much worse. Especially with the quarantine, I have been given a large amount of time to sit and think things over and over to the point of unhealthiness.\\n\\nI have begun distancing myself from people, and usually that would be a major sign to myself that things are getting bad, but it actually feels like my first step to healing. I am a very socially oriented person, and it is seriously taken a toll on me. Not to mention the fact that most of the people in my life would not even put a fraction of as much thought into me as I do them. \\n\\nIn an ideal situation, I isolate myself entirely from everyone, and take this time to learn how to focus on myself and bettering who I am. My only problem, however, is that I am very back-and-forth with things (eg. leaving a partner, claiming it is for mental healing, and then coming back mere days later)  I convince myself that everybody overthinks as much as I do, and i convince myself i want that. I convince myself that I am happy in whatever situation I am in, and it always brings me back, no matter how terrible the scenario. \\n\\nWhat I feel like I need is a sign, I feel like I need something to remind me to never truly trust anybody, I need to be reminded that I never really mattered to them, because I do not. I need to push myself away from contact because somewhere through the years, I never learnt to be truest to myself. I need to be told that people leave and people die, and the only constant in my life will ever be me. I need to gain that sense of selfness that I am sure could better me as a person.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat being said, it is 9:46 Am and I have not  slept in two days, so this may be total nonsense. If anyone decided to read through this total dumpsterfire, well, Thank you, very very dearly. It means more than you know.I had an online friend for 2 years. He was the only one I talked to for 2 years. He talked me out of commiting suicide and helped me through depressive episodes. But then my dumbass starts to fall for him. At first it seemed like he felt the same, but then out of nowhere he told me he could not do it because he was too depressed. I respect that, but he also does not want to continue our friendship. He says it would not be the same. I ffng loved him, he was the only person in te world I cared about. I feel so alone, I feel like I am losing it. Why does everyone I care about walk out on me. it is come to the point where I do not see the point in continuing my life and it is killing me slowly.I was wondering if I am alone in this thinking -\\nMy parents and grandparents died at fairly early ages...50\\'s to 70\\'s.\\nAs I consider the early ages of my parents and grandparents deaths, I am preoccupied with the idea that I am genetically predisposed to follow suit.\\nSo, at the age of 60, I am just waiting for the shoe to drop, so to speak (develop cancer or something).\\nI have dealt with severe depression all my life...and now at my age, this preoccupation feeds right into my depression.\\nIs there anyone out there that deals with something similar?I credit my low self-esteem to all the years of being overworked and made to feel lesser in the military. I joined when I was 17 and I worked so hard to try to show everyone that I was good enough to be a Marine. In the end, I was just another cog that was continuously grounded down until it was time to replace me. All those years of being told that I was worthless have bled into my life post-military. \\n\\nI have struggled with depression and anxiety for the past five years. I have seen several therapists, most of them dismissing my case as a minor case. I have been suicidal only once after I attempted to end it with a gun in my mouth. My vice became alcohol and its wondrous ways of allowing you to forget the pain, even if it is temporary. \\n\\nWhen my son was born, all that changed. My days are brighter now with the newfound purpose of being a dad. I do not drink that often anymore and seeing my son\\'s smile helps me forget my pain better than any bottle ever could. \\n\\nBut, when he is not there, I still fight to keep my demons at bay. I can hear them clawing in the back of my mind, telling me that everyone\\'s life would be better off with me dead. My life insurance would help my spouse have a home, it would pay for my son\\'s college, and set my parents and brother up for a long stretch of time. I have thought about it so many times. \\n\\nMy depression is my own. It defines me when I am at my weakest. It subsides when I am at my strongest. it is a battle I will fight for the rest of my life. One I will suffer everyday for if it means seeing my son\\'s smile again.I think I have come to terms with it. that is how I die. I know when. I know how. I know why. There is an odd sense of relief that comes over me when I think about it, I do not have to worry about anything anymore. No more loneliness, no more pain. It will all be over soon, all I have to do is wait a little bit longer and it will be perfect.I have not been suicidal since 4th grade and it feels really good to be back in this situation. I have always had chronic depression but it has not been this dark in years. \\n\\nI know the title is clickbait but I truly feel this way. It feels like now I have hit a new low and I can make progress to get out of it. Chronic depression is frustrating because it is a constant kinda shitty feeling. it is like wanting to cry after a hard day, week, month and not being able to. Once you finally cry it is so freeing and cathartic. \\n\\nRight now I feel more positive than I have been, maybe ever. it is only up from here for me. Maybe I will have a few down turns but ultimately its for the best&#x200B;\\n\\nI have been depressed before and I have tried to kill myself twice but I failed both times. Life is going great for me but I have been feeling numb the past few weeks, I can not seem to figure out why.\\n\\nI have no one to talk to or could help me anymore, I have lost the privilege of having someone I could hold onto/count on so usually I would cut my tummy with a razor to calm myself down but today, \\n\\nI was crying really hard about NOTHING and I walked into the laundry room and straight up took a long sip of bleach and poured it all over me, I ruined a set of pjs and my favourite socks.\\n\\nThen I cleaned up the laundry room and went into the shower and sat under running water for about an hour. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI do not feel sick or anything now but I am scared to tell my mum that I drank bleach so I do not really know what to do and i read an article  about how someone drank a tub of bleach and died a few days later; I only took a sip though, I hope nothing happens.my bestfriend wants to die now, so am i. she wants to die because of her fucked up father who is always physically and mentally abusing them. i am the only one she talks to about that and i want to help her. but i do not know what to do because I am just as hopeless as her. we are both tired of living. but I am telling her that taking our lives is not a good choice. but still, i want to help her. but how?When I was younger I have faint memories of being abused which caused me to become hyper sexual at a young age. I seemed to have blurred the lines of right and wrong and made excuses for people I cared about.\\n\\nSex was not talked about to me ever at all in my family. I was an awkward shy kid full of shame and highly sensitive/insecure. I found porn on a TV I had and porn in my dads room. It haunted me at first and then I got curious and would look at it sometimes. Cut to my teens when puberty hit for me (F)(I was a late bloomer 14/15) and my sexual urges became heightened. I was confused because noone talked about it with me. Fast forward one day my dog sniffed my private while I was changing and I thought \"i wonder what oral would feel like” because i saw it in porn and i thought other kids my age were trying it whilst also copying porn. I put something over my underwear for her to lick off and I remember thinking i was only going to do it for a second but it lasted longer. After i felt weird and dirty but brushed it off. About a year later I eventually told my mom bc the guilt was eating me alive. And now it is coming back again years later. I feel paralyzed with guilt and shame. I feel like I destroyed my life. idk how to move on. Is there a way? I feel so alone but also deserving. I would never physically hurt a person or animal and it makes me feel like shit that I thought that was ok at the time.  I have prayed to god for forgiveness every time I think about it and will be for the rest of my life but I do not feel forgiven bc I can not seem to forgive myself. Quite frankly it makes me feel like i was like an abuser/predator and my mind connects with awful criminal type people. I want to feel like a good person again but my thoughts want me to punish myself but i can not bc i love my family and they hate seeing me in bed 247.  \\n\\nHas anyone else overcome/done something like this? Is this a common adolescent thing? I feel extremely embarrassed and alone about this please helpit is the second week of taking BC, and these couple days have been feeling like hell. Today is the worst. My original plan was to go to the grocery store and home workout, the usual quarantine routine. However, I feel exhausted and lightheaded. I thought I just did not have enough sleep, but a 2-hour nap did not help at all. \\n\\nMy emotion is probably hitting the lowest at all time. I am easily triggered by little things, which lead to me sobbing uncontrollably for a couple times today. I have talked to a couple of close friends and family about the side effects of the pills, but I did not mention how much of a disaster it costs to mental health, as an attempt to try to keep my sanity, but I know I am only barely holding onto it. Even though I enjoy living alone, the loneliness and daily isolation even made it worse on all kind of level. I am not sure what is my next step, either to inform my gyno or go to therapy.I do not have a job anymore and I am too depressed to try to find another one (if there are any).  I just stay at home hating myself. I stopped eating, stopped washing myself, and I almost do not sleep anymore. I wish I had the strenght to get my shit together and find a solution, but I can not. After all, like people on reddit have told me countless times, I am just a \"whiny littlr bitch\".I have never felt so lonely in my life, and I am lonely at baseline. This is getting to be too much. I sit in bed all day, not being able to get a handle on my binge eating disorder. What else would I do? I am empty. This has been the worst I have ever felt with my depression. I understand what is healthy for you and what is not. I have tried sitting out in fresh air with a cup of tea but the sinking numb feeling was still overwhelmingly there. I tried to go on walks and runs but I just want to go back home the entire time. I stare at these walls all day. I text people who do not text me first but honestly I do not care, not seeing people in person is getting stale. I need human interaction. I am an “essential worker” or whatever as a nurse but I am a new nurse so this shit is really stressful and hard. My preceptor tears me apart. So the time I should be using to relax and recuperate is filled with staring at walls, being alone. I have never felt so off the handles in my life. I have turned to wine because it makes me feel normal, but I have a family history of addiction. So I have had to tell myself no a few times. Feels like my life is going absolutely no where. Maybe it is going no where. I just need this to be over so maybe I can see that one friend that hangs out with me. I am going insane.Sometimes I can not sleep at all during a bad depressive episode. Like I am talking days, it is like I will close my eyes and instead of sleep it is just this endless buzz in my head of everything that is wrong with me and my surroundings. I am plagued by exhaustion, yet cannont sleep and instead lie awake in a negative thought loop. Unable to move, unable to distract myself, or sleep. I just lay there, unnervingly trapped by my own my mind. Listening to every thought that pops up.  This can last for days. Is anyone else plagued by this nasty insomnia?I am the odd one out in my family. Do nothing all day long. Too sad and depressed to do anything. Think about suicide a lot. it is been like this for too long and do not know what the hell I can do.It drives me up the fucking wall when people say it gets better. I have had ONE single issue be the main because of my depression my entire life. that is a lack of a social life. \\n\\nI am incredibly lonely. As in I have NEVER had friends in real life. I have tried everything and anything. Fuck off with the \"it gets better!\" \\n\\nI can only imagine if my depression was not situational. My situation can theoretically change, as it is an outside factor (even though I know it will never change), but if my depression was not situational, hearing that would drive me nuts. It does not get better a lot of the time. Sorry for the cold truth. \\n\\nI still think life is precious(?) and should not be ended early. Experience it while you can even if it sucks ass. because you will never get another chance. I just live for food and videogames, but there is always something semi-enjoyable out there that you will never get another chance in eternity to experience. Just wish people would stop with that dumb fucking lie. it is just such a stupid thing to say.I am so tired and so depressed, but my anxiety always makes me complete my work last minute. I am so stressed out and I feel like I am on the verge of a mental breakdown. I hate it, but there is nothing I can do.  I just keep doing my work and wishing I was dead and being terrified of getting bad grades. I hate this. Fuck this virus. It has literally made my mental illnesses 10x worse and there is nothing I can do.Every time when I ask myself \"why are you depressed?\" my answer is always I do not know or a spiral of self hate and things not working out, which is normal, its part of life. I do not know, I am just weak and I am a coward. Do I even know what depression is? what it means to be depressed? I do not know. Why do I find it so difficult to effectively convey my feelings to myself nevermind to anyone else. I do not know. I just do not know anymore. My life is fine. I just do not know why I am like this. I do not understand myself and I wish I did, but unfortunately, a guide book for my mind does not exist. And it is like I like being depressed, its almost as in I put myself in this mindset intentionally, which sounds quite crazy and sadistic. I like the pain, I like feeling worthless and a failure. But then, I do not like feeling like this and just want to be okay again, normal i guess. Ah I do not know. Whenever I feel like this, I just tell myself to \"firm it and keep moving\", it is the only thing I can do. But, I do not even know how long i can firm it until I am at a point of no return. I do not know.It sucks. It sucks monkey balls. It sucks so much, that it feels like I am suffocating.\\nBeing useless all your life and Everytime you do something, big or small it feels like \"is it worth it? Will it work? Will it make a change?\" Enough doubt and fear just takes over of you are not good enough, nobody is REALLY going to help you. Nobody cares, so why even try? \\nIf I really reach out for help in something not for me, will people even read it and help so I do not bare the blunt of guilt when it all goes wrong? \\n\\nSorry guys just wanted to vent here a bit. I will delete this later.I was venting a little and this person said ‘So why do not you kill yourself / did not kill yourself when you felt depressed?’ I know it was not meant  like in a bad way but I just feel like it was really inappropriate to ask me that. Am i overthinking this? as this is always stuck in my mind nowFor the first few weeks of lockdown I was almost inconsolable, but now I have found the one thing that helps - completely \\'tapping out.\\' it is utter bliss, like a taster of death without the commitment. Why is disassociation bad for you if it feels so good? It just feels completely freeing.https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3n0FFXGZlCEY5o8ZJ4i7Bh?si=DH7LIaWmSfC3vR0LQ2x66A[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3n0FFXGZlCEY5o8ZJ4i7Bh?si=DH7LIaWmSfC3vR0LQ2x66A)I have kept two \"friends\" around after finding out that both of em talk shit about each other behind their backs. They said plenty about me too. I kept them around because I found it so funny that they would constantly lie to my face. Had enough and cut them both off yesterday after threatening them. I do not know what came into me I guess  I was just so enraged that they lied to my face. \\n\\nThey tried getting back to normal with me by telling me that I got the wrong guy before I cut them off. They got upset that I threatened them and started yelling at me. I told him to stop the tough talk and roll up on me because they know where I live. It was going to be a knife fight. I grabbed my blade, my mask, and my hoodie and waited....and waited. They never showed up after the tough talk. \\n\\nI was really ready to die. All I could think was, kill. It seemed so unlike me, I did not know who I was in that moment. I have thought of buying a pistol and rolling up on em but once I calmed down I realized this is not worth it and left it as it was. I am so empty I only have two emotions. Numb or enraged. If I do not control myself I am going to end up dead or worse, in prison. \\n\\nMy depression is the angry type. I never thought it would get this bad to where I would literally flirt with danger. \\n\\nI just needed somewhere to put this. Thank you for reading if you did. Otherwise -\\n\\nTLDR: Kept fake friends around to learn how to see through them. They lied to my face, I got enraged, invited them to a knife fight. Came to the conclusion I need to get help.my mom misunderstands depression on a fundamental level. i do not think she will ever really understand. it sucks. it makes me feel stuck. there is nothing i can do, nowhere i can go. I am trapped in this house full of insensitive and ignorant people. it hurts. my mental state is so fucked.Hi I am new to this sub I am 20 years old and lately I keep having weird dreams that my fiancé is cheating on me I can not help but go through his phone sometimes and I find things I do not like sometimes I talk to him about it but sometimes I just keep it to myself because I do not want to have the conversation I just want to have happy days with him but now I am to the point I want to just stop breathing at a times...I love this man more than anyone I do more for him than I have ever done for myself and my heart is aching the past 2 years we have gone through nothing a young couple should have to go through but it has grown us closer and stronger together as a couple I just do not understand I am so loyal I have Always been that way I am just so lost and sad and I have no one to talk to someone help...Last month I lost my sister in a car accident. We had a bond which was tighter than the one I have with my parents. I am not able to sleep at night. I actually fear going to sleep (dark thoughts come across my mind). \\n\\nI miss here so so terribly. She was young just 24. The achiever within the family while I still struggle in college. It should have been me. I try to be brave for my parents. But they too are too broken to recover. it is too much. \\n\\nI can not go on. I do not see it ever getting better.\\nit is just too much. Too much... \\n\\nit is 3 in the morning.\\nAnd the demons have returned.\\nIn my mind I hear a warning.\\nBut it is too late to run.\\n\\nI want to scream and thrash.\\nBut I am tied me to the bed.\\nA tear rolls down my cheek.\\nSignaling my spirit to be dead.\\n\\nA calmness comes over me.\\nI find comfort in the inevitable.\\nBut then images of my family float.\\nAnd thus starts the trouble.\\n\\nI am at crossroads, not sure what to do.\\nHad you been here, I would not be feeling so blue.\\n\\nI make up my mind.\\nFar too long have I suffered.\\nOver the table lies the tiny escape.\\nIt will be quick, it will be painless.\\nI say as my heart starts to flutter.\\n\\nI close my eyes, letting the deed take it is course.\\nthere is no turning back I say.\\nit is time to jump across.\\n\\nit is 3 in the morning\\nFinally will I sleep\\nAnd when I meet you in the light,\\nshall I smile and weepi feel like whenever i talk to somebody i make them feel bad bcs they know I am bad, they try to make me realize that I am in a bad mentality, and i end up screwing up everything and asking them to leave me alone in here, in my bad mentality, my even suicidal mentality these days\\ni asked my few friends to only text me if the conversation will end up with me being better but they do not care and we almost everytime end arguing bout shit that only makes me feel worse\\nalso, i feel pressured with the tasks from school bcs i know that my future is the one that will end up fucked if i do not do them but in my home there is only 1 computer for me, my mother, whose work is in the air at the moment, and my brother\\ni do not know what to do, i feel worse and worse, more distanced with people that was not distanced with me when this shit started\\nI am from Spain, i probably wrote something wrong gramatically or idk\\ni just want this shit to end, i had a weak mindset before this and this just made it even weaker\\n\\nas i said, English is not my first language so sorry if something is wrongI am always angry. Even when I am happy deep down there is this burning anger inside of me. I can mostly control it but every few years that fire burns too much for me to handle. When that happens people around me get hurt. I have been to therapy but that never helped. All therapy does is teach you how to bury that anger. It never teaches you how to control it. That I learned myself. I learned to focus that in things like the gym or in arguments. I occasionally use it to hurt people that deserve it. But recently I have stopped going to the gym because of my depression. And due to the corona virus there is no ways for me to use my anger productivity. I can feel the flame getting bigger and I know sooner or later it is going to take over Andy family are going to be the ones who get burned. I need this lockdown to be over for their sake.What events triggered your depression early in your life? What triggers it now? What prevented you from seeking help before? What difficulties do you have with practicing your coping skills? Can you identify your mood and activities throughout the day? What pleasant activities do you do in order to cope? What events led you to the hospital? \\n\\nI am trying to help my therapist understand me better but I do not understand a lot about myself.its me again. I have watched a movie with my sister, imaginaerum, and honestly i got deep in thought\\n\\nfor those who did not watch, relationship of main character gem with her father is the key point of the movie. she is salty, she is pissed, she hates him most of the time but ends up forgiving him before he passes away.\\n\\nand all that got me thinking of how much my life is ruined now and beyond fixing because my father was doing what he wanted all the time. usually it was drinking and trying to hit the jackpot. he spend all his life being given things, so he wanted to be rich easly too. except... then he would waste it all to get drunk. and its been always like that, aside from threats about killing my mom flying around the house, broken plant pots, plates and other stuff. he chilled now but I am still here stuck with him.\\n\\nand i can not even think of what i lost because of him. my childhood, my possible friendships, my possible romance, my holidays and vacations, my education, three years wasting away at home and then another three of wasting away and *sometimes* going to shit job that i hate with horrible pay. and all this is still continuing and i can not start living because lol... for what money\\n\\ni can not even have good paying job because I am hs dropout. i do not have driving license either. i started the course to get it two years ago but i did not pass two exams and quit trying... that is pretty telling about me\\n\\ni just. need someone to help me pull it together because i can not do it on my own. and i got no one. i just can not do this anymore i hate him so much he destroyed everything for me, even my own brain. otherwise i would not have this awful depression with szpd. i just can not anymoreI have been depressed for about 1,5 years now, possibly more. besides the counselor i was talking to last year i have not told anyone definitively that I am depressed. in fact i go to great lengths to convince people around me the opposite, that I am happy. i think some of the closest people know I am struggling, but I have never talked about it.\\n\\nthe reason is that I am ashamed to feel like this. I am afraid that word gets around that “OP is depressed” and so on. i basically fear being judged, but also that i will be treated with pity. I mean like people that draw (or who is dealing with art) for a living are seen as useless to the world. I like drawing because it helps me think away from all the bad shit and I want to pursuit in my life as a software engineer but every time I show one of my drawing piece to one of my friends or family they encourage me to pursuit drawing instead and his advice makes me feel dumb(mentally) numb and useless. please help\\ni feel so unimportant, so useless that my words do not even matter, i try to talk about how i feel to people or in a place like this but i always feel so stupid after, I am wasting people’s time. i do not get why I am rejecting my own feelings, the experiences i go through. maybe i have not suffered enough, i do not have a direct because for my depression, i do not know how long I have felt like this, just a long time. i know how it feels to hate waking up every day, crying at the fact you woke up again. so why can not i let myself be listened to, have someone help me.like the title says i do not have desire to do stuff anymore. anytime i think about doing something i almost always seem to resort to “i really do not have the energy for this”. \\nit is like in general the effort needed to do ANYTHING vastly outweighs the reward. i go to work, because you need to for income, but that is about it. i think due to depression my brains reward system is not working correctly, this could be symptoms of anhedonia.I am **SO SICK** of being more emotionally mature than my own mother, especially since 1) I am not actually all that emotionally mature and 2) I am stuck living with her. At 29. Because I am so emotionally immature that I could not finish college or get a job that pays enough or keep the job I did have because I am such a fuck-up.\\n\\nThat is all. Just really needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for letting me vent to you instead of blowing up at her and making things even worse.Everyday one of my thoughts say mm what if you just kill yourself but then I think in my mom and the pain I because her and that stops me but i hate this life I am not happy I hate my lifei just do not want to talk to anyone everything just annoys me and pisses me off i hate this i hate myself i hate everythingPeople are dying everyday and it could have been prevented. People think it is a conspiracy. it is not as bad as pneumonia they say. All you need to take are vitamins. I am constantly surrounded by ignorant selfish people who parrot what the news tells them. There is no convincing them otherwise. They think this is all fake. They vote against their own interests. They are making the world worse. I am tired of people being this dumb and selfish. I wish I was not around any more. I believe in God but I can not understand why this needed to happen. I can not believe what is happening everyday. I can not believe how shitty people are. I wish everyone could just wake up. I just can not deal with this anymore.I am 17 and i really do not want to live anymore. now this prob sounds like the edgy teenager that does not want to live anymore but listen, i genuinely do not want to. my life is going into the shit, and I am not doing too good so I am giving myself a year, it its still fucking shit and life is a giant burden and i can not find anything to live for then I am out of here. I am sick and tired of cutting myself and crying until i can not anymore. I am sick and tired of missing someone who is with someone else. I am sick and tired or just being stressed and never feeling happy. i really hope my life works out in a year but this is it ig. if i can not find anything to live for then i do not want to live anymore.Hey there, everyone. This will be a slightly long post, so I will understand if you do not read all the way through. \\n\\nI am an international student who has previously applied to the United States for further education, along with scholarships in my home country. The results were abysmal - I got rejected from 6 out of the 8 universities which I applied to, had to rescind one offer because I could not supply my finances in time and got accepted into one. I have had no luck on the scholarship front either. \\n\\nI have not been taking this news well at all. I was really harbouring great dreams to go to the US to study music, and it feels like my dreams have all been smashed. I genuinely thought I had a chance of getting in to the schools I wanted, but now it feels like reality has delivered the verdict, and the truth of it is I simply have not accomplished as much with my life as I thought I did. It feels like all I have done has amounted to nothing. \\n\\nA good majority of my close friends did manage to get into reputable overseas universities, and I can not help feeling left out and utterly inferior to them. I can not socialise with other people now without constantly being reminded of my own inability to achieve things. They say that to be successful you ought to surround yourself with successful people to learn from them, but all I feel is inadequacy. \\n\\nI have also felt that my learning capabilities have become compromised. Now I feel either cynical, impatient or resigned while learning. I have no mood to learn new things and I can not help getting a feeling of, \"my time has passed, I should have done all these things during childhood,\" when picking up new skills. I get really impatient now and constantly expect quick results, which usually do not happen and end up making me even more frustrated. \\n\\nI have had depressive episodes before, but last year was really a hopeful and inspiring one because I was stepping out of my comfort zone and I was really trying to take life in new directions I had not gone to before. 2020 is turning out to be the antithesis of that - getting rejected feels like all I am doing has come to naught and everything I have tried to build has been a lie. I am sinking into a slump where every day just passes by in a blur and I do not know how to shake it off. \\n\\nThis is just a bad year all-round. I am aware that all of this has sounded like self-absorbed narcissistic whining, but I wanted to get it off my chest regardless. Thanks everyone if you have read this far, and I hope that all of you are coping well with the coronavirus quarantine yourselves.I do not even know where to start to be honest. I wan\\'t to visit someone for help whether it be a doctor to inject me with momentary happiness that I need to restock, or someone to talk to on a regular basis. Life is getting rough though. And I am not talking about the whole Covid-19 situation as it does not phase me, my lifestyle, nor my employment. Rather life\\'s toll has become every increasing. I play songs at night and they keep me awake in a pool of tears for various reasons. I find a new song an within a week it will make me burst out in tears. I have lost all enjoyment from my passion. I miss my childhood most of all and wish I could reset my life. Start over and correct my screw ups. I know it is not possible. I have spent nights praying to gods I do not believe in for any kind of escape. Begging to make a deal with the devil for a window of escape, but to no avail. The color of the world has started to fade. Every day I miss work more and more. I go on a week long binge of skipping work because I can not bear to get out of bed. I would rather sit and do nothing. Trash piling up around me. I can not listen to music anymore without getting emotional and watching videos or playing games feels bland and boring. I try to sing, write, draw, anything. Nothing makes me feel anything. I started drinking more and more, but it is just blurring everything together. I do not know where I am going with this, but I feel lonely, afraid, and like I am slowly losing touch with reality.One of my core issues was taking love so seriously as to let it be one of the causes of my depression. Throughout high school, my main problem was trying to find that coveted word, online and in person, failing over and over and over. It was a passion equal to my true passion, fiction writing. \\n\\nOver the years, I have come to realize how it is pointless to waste energy on romantic love. Time and time again, I find the energy I put into that is the energy that should be veered toward actual important endeavors. \\n\\nAlthough the desire is not nearly as strong as it was in high school, I still desire it and I still fear having it taken away from me, which seems to be the case now. What I realize after a post I saw on FB one day is that, I could have and can be working near my highest potential if I would let that part of me go. Surely, I would feel less depressed if I stopped putting my worth in that sickening want. It would be a weight lifted off my shoulders. \\n\\nSo now I am trying to find a way to staunch that desire entirely or near enough.I hate myself more than anything in this messed up world , but I am done waiting for some miracle or sudden change. It is not going to happen by itself.\\n\\nI have extreme depression , anxiety , suicidal thoughts 24/7 and I know one day I am going to end my own life . But I want to have some fun before it. \\n\\nI want to get high , drunk with friends , go to a club , have sex , travel and have a real fancy meal in a fine restaurant. My life goals are not complex , but those memories will be everything I will have while looking back at my shitty \"life\".\\n\\nI just hope this terrible times with corona will pass as soon as possible , so I can get out of my home prison and try to feel alive and not dead and hollow inside.\\n\\nFuck school and terrible  abusive parents who do not understand grades are not important if just not committing suicide or self-harming takes the majority of your energy and focus.\\n\\nIf you struggle with suicidal thoughts or you think you might be starting to develop depression , please go see a professional before it is too late like for me.My ex and I are on very good terms. We are both struggling with depression and decided now was not a good time for either of us to be dating. \\n\\nAnyways, we are talking as friends and I am slowly but surely becoming ok with not being together as we were. It was a short relationship though it was codependent so bonds were formed very quickly and strongly. \\n\\nWhen I close my eyes I imagine she is holding me, telling me everything will be okay, as she has in the past. I am having a hard time seeing this as a friendship even though I know that is what is best for us both. \\n\\nDo you have any advice on how to handle this alone and viewing her as a friend? Also, any ideas on other things I can imagine when that image pops into my head?I was not always this stupid. A mixture of indulgence and bad timing made me like this. I was a smart kid and took it for granted. I had a general grasp on topics, but only took interests in sports, music, video games and girls. So dumb. I am utilizing none of these interests for my everyday life.\\n\\nMy father succumbed to cancer when I was 14 and I am 22 now. He had it for 5 years prior and those years seemed to last decades and minutes at the same time. Decades because of how everyone approached me and treated me just because my dad had cancer. Minutes because of the knowledge I was able to extract from my dad. I always wish I asked more questions, but what did I know at that age. \\n\\nThis dilemma stunted my growth into becoming who I am. I still do not really know, honestly. I became numb to everything and stopped caring about my future because I did not know what life would be like without my best friend. it is awful kid.\\n\\nNow that I am older and in my prime, I can only think about how I have wasted my life. Quitting college after a year, no girlfriend, no job and living at home again because of a pandemic. I do not know where to go and I am tired of pretending that life will find a way. Life’s “way”, leads me to more and more pain without any compensation. My patience for my death is dwindling daily. Idk why I made this post because you all have your own issues. I just want a reason to stay alive.I am going through a hard time in my life (is not everyone these days).\\nI think I might be breaking up with my long term boyfriend. And I am... pretty broken up about it. Constant, fat tears... I could not stop shuddering... I was in physical pain and it felt like my chest was collapsing in on itself. The worst part about this is that he was my only friend. I literally have *no one* to talk to about this. I do not have a support system. It was just him. I know that was unfair, but I was trying to change it. All of my friendships have fallen apart for various reasons that I had nothing to do with. I do not feel close with my family. I did not mean to make him my only point of support. I guess it does not matter now. I have no one to message and just talk to. Of all the people I do know, I am not close enough to any of them to reach out. they are not anything beyond surface level friends. it is not their fault, or bad necessarily. they are good people. I do not blame them. I feel a sense of mourning. I never got to tell him that for months I have been thinking about how great it will be to put his towel in the dryer while he showers, but I did not want to tell him (and I am terrible at keeping secrets) because I wanted to see the surprised look on his face. I will never see that now. I feel weird “mourning” the family we would have had and the life we would have built. Thinking about that makes me wonder if I am making a mistake by stepping back, but talking to him right now is bringing such great emotional pain that I physically hurt. I never wanted this to happen. I was afraid something like it would. I am realizing now that is what I would be telling a friend if a had one. Now that I have slept a little and I am sitting here... I feel this calm melancholy. My chest still hurts but I have stopped crying. I desperately do not want it to be... but I think it is over. I have this feeling, like... it is hard to describe. I know I have been too much of a burden on him, and he will never directly tell me but being with him is too much for him and it is hurting him. I am hurting him by being with him because of the way I am. I question if I ever actually worked on myself... I think I did. But in hard times I have been melting a little, and I think it is just too much. This, combined with som other crap that happened a little while ago, just makes me feel so... numb. I do not think it is really sunk in yet to be honest. \\nI love him so, so very much but the pain is just too much. Some of it is not his fault but I also feel like he could have taken a leap of faith for me, and did not, and I am crushed. I thought I had shown that I would have his back, but thinking backwards in time to other conversations we have had, it is clearer to me he does not completely trust me for some reason and I do not know why. His schooling means so much to me, I would not have gotten in the way of that... I would have done everything to help make it easy. Make help him staying here as comfortable as possible. I believed he would want to stay, to weather this storm together... but I was wrong. Said he did not think it through enough. He talked to his family and they advised against it... I understand because of the circumstances... I feel like they mistrust me too... for some reason there was some perceived I will intentions in things went down... but I just wanted to see him. They said it was okay and after believing all this time he would come be by my side, he said no. And it is not just that he is not here with me. He thinks I would not do everything and anything to help facilitate his success and help him thrive. I do not know why. A long time ago, we were talking about something to do with school, and I can not remember the specifics but he said something to effect of “I do not trust you to not get mad at me for doing my work” or something. And I *heard* him, and I swear I was not doing anything but being supportive of him going to school but he felt like I would impede him. I was crushed then, we were sitting in my car but I made an excuse to go to the bathroom to go cry. I do not know what I did to make him feel like he can not trust me.... I trust him completely and it lead to my heart feeling so broken. I feel like a sore idiot for going on about being sad and “heart broken” but if you really think someone is the one and it gets messed up... I am reeling. If I had known that the last time I saw him was going to he the *last* time... I can not think about it too much or I will just cry. I do not really know what to say now. I tried to keep my cool so that he would see I was trying to be responsible, and he would see I was trying to be good. I did not want to lose my marbles and ask him why or be sad, I have ruined any chance of seeing him at all. None of this has properly sunk in. I do not have to save my Instagram memes anymore, all of what I have saved is... just... nothing now. I will never get to hug him again, I can not show him how much I care and that I would never hurt him and that I want him to feel whole and happy... I will never get to live with him and warm his towels or have his beans or know what it is like to be with him. I feel like I am doing something rash... but there is this weird calm... I think it has to be this way... he will be able to thrive without me, and I know he will be able to do his work with flying colors... I am not worried about that. But I just feel so... lost. \\n\\n\\nWhat now ?I do not really know if this is the right subreddit but I have no idea where else to turn. I am a guy so it feels like no one really takes me seriously. \\n\\nFuck man I am getting so tired and I do not know how to express what I am feeling and English is not my först language so this might be just me rambling incoherently and I am sorry about that but I hope you can bare me out because I really need to get this shit off my chest... \\n\\nMy mom and dad split when I was very young \\nMy mom had 2 kids before me and a lie after me, all with different men and all of them bailed and left my mom with the kids(except my dad). \\nShe used a lot speed and gambled her way into debt and struggled alot with mental illness \\nShe could not handle everything so i moved to my dad and his new woman (I call her mom) and her daughter (my big sis) when I was 2. \\nFrom there on I spent 1 week at my dad and then 1 week at my moms. So I was kind of the outsider of both of my families, this continued for quite a while, 2 different sides of life. \\n\\n1 week at my dads place, which was a nice smalltown with a nice daycare and school and 1 week with my mom and my now 3 other siblings (i got a new younger sister) wherever we lived at the moment ( she moved around quite a lot) \\n\\nI liked to be at my moms place, she was not as strict as me ex military dad but he had his reasons. But I spent my entire childhood going back and forth between two different worlds and missing out on both, not feeling like I was in center of anything, on my moms side I think I was seen with some resent for being able to live with my fancy dad and still being the most chaotic of us. And at my dads they saw me as a kid who could not behave. \\n\\nI was outside everywhere. Friend groups, family and just mentally alone, but god knows I tried, I tried way to hard and that fucked it up for me everytime but I tried. My parents hated eachother for so long and I was a pawn in my moms game and I ended up hating my dad for many years and I Will always hate myself for that, he was hard on me but he is a goddamn good dad and he tried. He even tried when I was a heavy drug user at 16 to 20 years old. He saw me take my older brothers (moms side) steps and he could not see all the mental problems I had and I do not blame him, he grew up where men did not show that they suffered so it angered him. \\n\\nI was pretty good at masking my lonlieness with friends who liked that I did stupid shit and that I got angry easily. But Fuck I spent so many years crying myself to sleep and sleeping in the warmth of the shower. I just wanted to feel like I belonged. \\nFast forward to 2017 and many drugs and bad behaviour, my parents kicked me out and I spent a year couch surfing and sleeping rough until I met my girlfriend, half a year after my ex cheated on me with my friend and after I vowed to never trust love because I fall really easy and I have bad judgement but damn it was like the sky turned and I felt like home, I can not describe it but it felt like your soul got a warm close hug after staying at the bottom of a cold sea. All my self harm, all the cuts, all the drugs, every lonley night every single time I tried to make it over the edge of that fucking bridge, every overdose. It was all worth it and I would have done it 10 times over. She was so goddamn beautiful, and those eye man... those eyes. I would break every bone in my body just to look into those eyes and be certain that it was with love they looked back at me again.\\n\\nThe first mistake I made was that I went to fast, I moved in in under a month and I was blind to the signs. I know I fall for the broken type and you would think that comes with a certain eye for when things are sketchy but no. It took me 4 months until I realised that she was cheating with multiple guys and I stood there outside the window and seeing her in panties on a guy on the couch. That was 2 years ago on the 9th of april and I am too this day certain that a part of me died that night. I went in and picked up my stuff and went on my way to my first OD in a while. I survived. I licked my wounds for a while knowing I had to keep of the drugs I had already damaged my family, my mom my dad and my 2 angels ( my younger sisters) I could not get lost again, I needed them to see me happy and alive.\\n\\nMy girlfriend wanted me back and I could not walk away from that feeling I had before, even if that meant living with the old familiar feeling of never being someones number one. For a year forward I was treated like shit and still saw signs of infidelity until I caught her with more then just messages. She had been to a guys place pretty close to where we lived so I went to talk to him (She was at Home every day while I was working full time so we could survive) he told me they had met but nothing had happened, but that she had been coming on pretty strong but he did not like her.\\n\\n I Think she was looking for a guy similar to the guy I first guy I caught her with... She would have done anything for him. It took her over a year to post that she was in a relationship with me because she was afraid what he would think. I did everything for her but he was still number one. \\nAnyways... \\n\\nI confronted her and she told me she loved me now, forreal and she had problems and wanted to change so she changed (or cleaned up her act) and she worked on herself and slowly began to treat me better. But it never felt like she is really attracted to me like she had been to other guys, even then when really hot women came onto me I never gave or give anyone a single signal. Instead I am always there for my baby, when she is down i leave work and come Home, when we fight and she turns it around to be my fault I say I am sorry, and its slowly killing my self respect. And now 2020 its much better between us and I have my son (my dog) who means the world to me and my family is so proud of me and everyone turns to me with their problems because its easy to talk to me and I understand them but I am so fucking lost, I am a guy but why does noone hug me when I am down, why do a man have to ask his woman to go an extra mile to pick him up. Why is a man seen as annoying when he is needy? Why do only girls deserve romantic gestures that solidify what love someone have for them. I am so tired of being ashamed for being down and sad, for crying and not being able to pick myself up and be happy. Why do not I deserve to feel like I know where home is? I can not see a home in the world as it is and it breaks me every single day to wake up with this feeling, being surrounded by people but feeling like the lonliest man alive, deattached from everyone. I can not even sleep and find peace because there are the nightmares and sleep paralysis waiting and the sleeping meds are a joke, the therapist meetings just makes me feel more alienated. I am just so fucking lost\\n\\nsorry for the bible.I used to always say I had no time to do what I wanted to do because of school. But when virus put school on stop, I did not do any of the things I wanted to do. I had an anxiety attack as I there were so many things I wanted to do, but I felt so hopeless, and I did not know what to do. I feel like there is so much I want to express but there is no activity I do not feel stressed, or frustrated in. I just want to have a moment where I do not fuck anything up, because it seems that I have not done anything right my entire life. I feel so fucking hopeless all the time.I will make it short\\n\\nI am in my late 20s, graduated 4 years ago with a useless degree\\n\\nBeen working in retail part time and taking care of my I will parents and grandparents\\n\\nMy \"friends\" are already married or in a relationship with good and well paid jobs always bully me that I am a parasite who lives at home and it is my fault. Believe me that it is very difficult to find a good job with zero connections and move alone because no savings at all...\\n\\nThis covid19 that destroyed the global economy serves me as an \"excuse\" to why I still live with my parents because now I am unempLoyed but nowadays IT IS FUCKING NOT MY FAULT!!!!!!!!!! NEARLY 25% OF UNEMPLOYMENT HERE!!!!!!\\n\\nSo, without the covid19 I think that I would have ened up really depressed because of my failure to become a real person like everybody else. N eeded to vent.I am so emotionally tired, of everything. I look back on my life and see a never ending amount of failures. Went through a length unemployment gap and was then employed as an employment consultant. Presumably to churn and burn me. I should be thrilled for even having a job, but honestly I fucking hate it. The kpi’s, the constant up and down rollercoaster of emotions everyday, difficult clients and just being told to shake it off. it is a horrible industry and I feel like I am losing myself.\\n\\nI am a sensitive person, I am not ashamed of that. It allows me to read people really well. But honestly, it is a blight and fucking curse. \\n\\nWhere do I fit? Obviously fucking no where. Non existence would be blessing, and not waking up even better. Clocks tickingI can not sleep right anymore. Waking up every few hours from a nightmare about her to cold sweat and a pillow full of tears is taking its toll on me. I kept having the same nightmares every time I close my eyes. I kept seeing her with someone else in my nightmares and I know she is probably with someone else in my reality too. It hurts the most when you know she has moved on. How could she move on so fast? We broke it off for a few days and she is already talking to someone new. Was it really love if she could just move on that fast from a 5 years relationship? 5 years and it only took her a few days to start talking to someone new? I know I did many things wrong and I regret every single one of them, but how can she just throw away 5 years full of memories for a new person just like that? \\n\\nThe pain is too much, my head hurts, my heart hurts, everything hurts. I have been spiraling with hard drug abuse and I do not know if I can take it anymore. I told myself I would never touch those substances ever in my life, yet here I am, abusing everything I could get my hands on.\\n\\nShe had blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her. It fucked me up knowing how I was the one she came to at 3am when she needed me the most, the one that I held on right when she had nightmares but also the one who disappeared when I felt the lowest and loneliest. \\n\\nI just hope I could call her and maybe hearing her voice would stop me from ending it all one day. Maybe she could convince me to keep living and the pain will subside. But for now, I hope it will look like an accident.I am just done, I have fought and fought but nothing gets better. I was happy like I was so fucking happy with my life and where things were at but 3 weeks ago everything started to just fall apart, I do not have a job anymore, The love of my life dumped me and I lost my nan, I thought it was okay because I blocked out all my emotions so I did not feel anything for a while but the past two weeks everything is too much for me. The only thing I want to honestly do is die because everything is too far gone to make things good again. I  just want to slit my wrists and be done with it because people are going to care just for a little while then their lives will go on like normal. I am useless and just a terrible person, I do not know when but soon I am going to at least try have the balls to just fucking end it because there is no point for me to live anymore. it is only when I feel so sad and depressed that people give a shit. I am FUCKING DONE I can not FUCKING DO THIS FUCK THIS PLACE AND FUCK THIS WORLD.I [20F] have been wanting to take meds because I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd for 6 years now. I have been on and off meds and in and out of hospitals at the start. I have not taken meds in about a year because I still live with my mother and she does not like me taking them. It actually weakens our relationship because of how angry she gets when I have them prescribed. She tells me, “you have been doing so well, why the f**k do you need drugs?!” and acts like I am some monster. The problem is, I rely on my parents to pay for my doctors visits because I only make enough money to pay my bills, and get gas to commute to school (far). Has anyone else been through this? I feel pathetic because I am 20 years old and my mom acts like I am doing a war crime by trying to better myself. I have tried yoga, exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc. Nothing holistic works when you genuinely have a chemical imbalance, what else am I supposed to do? I guess I am just here to find some support or people who can relate.\\n\\nTL;DR: My mom thinks I am insane for taking meds for my depression/anxiety/ptsd even though I am 20 years old and have been going through this for 6 years. It weakens our relationship when she finds out that i am taking them.I am at a point in my life where happiness is not an option anymore. Whenever I feel happy, I catch myself limiting this feeling, thinking I do not deserve it, it will not last and being happy is boring anyways. I feel good, being sad. I feel content with my life, a place of complacency, where I feel too good to change something, but too bad, to ever be truly happy. I feel that sadness gives me comfort in a twisted way. It gives me something to hold onto, something that I feel, if I try hard enough will never go away, unlike anything good that is ever happened to me. At this point I would rather be sad, than change something about myself. I do not know if I am making sense, I feel like I am losing my mind.I still live with my parents because I am 15 iv been depressed since around 11. I do not know how to explain it I am just a bunch of stuff \\nI am scared for my future, if I am gona have a good life or be homeless \\nMy grades are low and it is hard for me to fix them \\nMy parents usually yell at me because of that eaven tho I am trying my best to make the situation better \\nI want to die but I do not \\nI have so many things I enjoy in life, things that I love and are hard for me to leave \\nBut at the same time I just feel empty and sad\\nI do not want to die because it will hurt my parents and make them think they where the because \\nit is hard for me to eaven imagine my mom\\'s reaction to my death \\nI can not realy be alone a loot so I mostly cry when I shower. That and seeing my body makes me eaven more sad because I do not like how I look it just makes my self esteem shrink \\nI have dreams and things I want to do but il never get a chance to do\\nI want to become an digital artist but I do not believe that I can do it. That and the fact that my country dosent realy put value in art stuff (I am from Croatia)\\nI am also gay and in a very religious family that is kinda toxic my mom and sister accept me but we do not talk about it. I do not think il ever get a boyfriend because of how homophobic my country is.\\nI am scared that il be a fail, that I will not have money when I grow up or that I will die alone.\\nBearing open to toxic religion from school in 3-4th grade elementary was not helpfull. Seeing somebody my age that is better than me makes me fall apart, I had a bunch of mental breakdowns in the school bathroom.aside from that a week beafore the schools where closed a group of guys got a pic of me in the bathroom stall and shared it around the school, that made me stay home till the schools where closed.\\nI do not know what to do any advice is good.I have decided today that after 2 years of repeating first year courses, that I need to drop out of school or else I will end up wasting more time and money on something that I am not even interested in. And it makes me feel like I have failed myself, and my parents. \\n\\nBut I think the worst thing is that I have realized recently that I have wasted the “best” years of my life, if you can call them that. I did not do anything in school but play videogames alone, I did not network or make friends or build interests or skills. I am just the same kid as when I went in, but now I am not a kid anymore so I can not even use that excuse anymore. \\n\\nI am going to have to start working again too, once I drop out. it is just going to make it worse. \\n\\nI do not want to end up being the guy who is 35 and works a non livable wage. I do not want to be the guy who is too boring to make conversation with. I do not want to be stuck in a place where I am in too deep to do anything with my life, but I already feel like I am there. \\n\\nI feel lost, I feel sad, and I feel like a giant disappointment.I am 27, but for like the last 15 years, getting worse each day, I resemble a broken, 60 year old widowed alcoholic who has given up and now just sits around drinking and smoking himself to death.\\n\\nI have not A DROP of energy, or hope, or motivation, or goals in me. Not a drop. All I have is agony. \\n\\nI have been so fucked by my brain ever since I was a small kid, that I am literally a walking zombie at this point.\\n\\nMy eyes are tired and sunken in. I can barely keep them open and always look angry/sad. \\n\\nThe corners of my mouth might as well have weights on them, that is how low they are by default. \\n\\nI am out of energy and falling asleep within 11am no matter how much I sleep, how I eat, exercise, and no matter what vitamins I take. \\n\\nI CANNOT shake the suicidal ideation for one second no matter what I do. \\n\\nNo matter where I turn, the thoughts are there. And they will make sure I hate myself so much that I am afraid of washing the dishes in case I just fucking slice my wrists with that big ass kitchen knife out of despair \\n\\nIdk what I am saying. I am just laying in bed trying not to cry like all the time, fantasizing I would get cancer or a brain aneurysm to save meI do not have any desire to live. I wish I could just leave and disappear from everything, everyone, all my problems. It would be perfect. I want an escape. As much as this concept is desirable I know it will not actually save me because I will always have my mind and in a matter of time I would start reciting the same thoughts of feeling trapped with nothing to live for. there is no escape for me. I am lost, I have no desire to think about my future but the pressure from my family and everyone around me becomes too much. Maybe I am naive but all I want in my life is freedom and my happiness, however I do not think I will be able to achieve either. I will never be free from my mind. The only way out for me is death, perhaps not perfect it is either that or live a miserable life.I need help. I feel like I am in a desperate situation. I do not know how to figure myself out. there is less light. About me: I am just a regular guy 18 years old. No bad habits. I have only got a couple of close friends I can share the most intimate things with. A family where I have been brought up quite freely. But talking about my experiences and feelings in 80% of cases ends in misunderstanding on their part, so I stopped sharing something deep with them. I will get to the problem. it is based on the choice of future professions. Three years ago, when my peers were deciding who they wanted to be, I could not identify any traits and hobbies that might have been prerequisites for my adult life. My parents advised me to be a doctor, because I would always have money for \"bread\" and I would not be lost or anything like that. Their ghostly beliefs imposed on me as a 15-year-old seemed convincing and I decided to get ready to go to medical university ... 3 years have passed. During that time, the thought that I was doing something wrong came to me occasionally. It was a year of passing exams with graduation and other formalities. The results of my exams were average, which did not satisfy my parents and I entered a higher education institution of our regional center, not a decent one. Even though I understood that my university was far from being prestigious, the understanding that my adult life had begun caused an ephemeral feeling of trembling before something new. But after two months of study, I began to realize that the university really sucks, because Russian education is one big disappointment (Yes, I am from Russia). I can tell you about the reasons. I feel devastated by broken expectations and an epiphany from the deep sleep I have been in all these years. I have no desire to learn. Parents try to understand when they missed the moment that everything came to what we have at the moment. I hope I was able to at least partially convey my message to you. I am not depressed, but sadness and apathy tell me that everything leads to it...I know they would affect everyone differently, but I would like to know if it is worth going on them. I already see a therapist for my anxiety, but I did not tell her exactly how depressed I feel (because of the anxiety). \\n\\nI do not know if she would be the right person to talk to about taking anti depressants or a doctor. I am on the pill, I do not really get side effects from that (I think) I have noticed some very small things but I have been on it for so many years that I do not know if it is side effects or just life in general.\\n\\nIs anyone able to share their experiences with me?no one caresI really wanted to learn photo and video editing, anything to do that makes me feel like I am good at sth, i went and downloaded the apps required, and have never even opened them ever since, why? Everytime I am like \"no.. I am not feeling it\", if i have ever even opened them i close them instantly like seconds after, i really want to exercise, even at home if gym is not possible currently, but i have no motivation at all, i just cannot do it... my brain is just like no, there is no point.\\n\\nI just go and sit in bed and think about what i could do with my life and what is the point of it.. which makes me even more depressed.I am living in another country due to my master\\'s degree. I do not want to go back to my country. I landed an internship at a really good company and it was about to convert into a full-time job but due to Covid-19, they told me they can not hire me right now so maybe after this situation settles down. I know for the fact that they will forget about me and the coronavirus situation will go on for a couple more months, I assume. The internship, itself was very hard to get and now all my efforts went down the drain. it is so hard for me to find a job here as to where I live there are less English speaking jobs and my level of the language of this country is basic. I enrolled in the language classes but due to odd jobs and internships, I could not complete them.  \\n\\nI feel like I am pathetic that I cannot get a job. I am a master\\'s student and wasted all my parents\\' money. Due to quarantine, I can not help but feel even more helpless than ever. I get panic attacks and thoughts of ending it all. My parents have told me already to come back as they can not keep on giving me money. I feel like that I have tried my best and I can not do more than this. I want and need to see a therapist but I was waiting to get a job and then go as I do not have money. I can not even make myself get better. I feel too much or sometimes nothing at all. I know these times have been hard for everyone and I am not special but I know there is nothing for me even when the virus situation gets better. I hate money and the ones who say that money can not bring you happiness have not lived a hard or a hungry day in their life.I feel that the universe is against me getting well.  The past 2 years have been hell.  I started into a downward spiral that i could not control.  I took an attempt on my life and was hospitalized.  \\nAfter starting meds again it took almost a year to get on the upswing again but the side effects took a toll on me. I stayed on the meds until i had a good grasp on my sanity again and went off of them feeling happy. (September)\\n\\nNow I have never really wanted to have kids (I am child free) and within weeks of being off of medication I got pregnant at 38. (October). \\n\\nI still did not want to have a child into this mess of my life.  I had an abortion as soon as i could. Because I got it so quickly, i was not able to speak to the doctor between having my ultrasound (to confirm how far i was into pregnancy) and the procedure day.  On the day of the procedure (November) i found out i had another large cyst on my ovary. I have had them surgically removed years ago, multiple times.  The cyst was too large to ignore it and the procedure i was having was not going to fix it. I had to schedule another surgery appointment for the new year.  \\n\\nHad the cyst removed and got my tubes tied. (January). The recovery from surgery was 4-6 weeks.  I do not heal quickly so it took me about 8 weeks to feel fully healed.  During my recovery i thought it would be good for me to take a trip.  I love to travel and had not done any big trips in 3 years.  Traveling far away from my problems is an empowering thing for me so i booked a trip through Italy (February). \\n\\n I was to leave on March 4th. I got a common flu days before i was to depart anyway so I am glad i did not go now as my flight home from Milan was cancelled. (March) The world went into lockdown mode, everyone has to stay home.  I need to get away.  \\n\\nI find some reprieve when i go to work (gas/oil sector) so i guess that is a plus.  I am still working my usual shifts (days and nights). i can not help but feel that  everything is working against my getting fully well again.  \\n\\nI am struggling right now.  I would normally just write all of this in my journal but i can not seem to find it.  I had an anxiety attack when i could not find it so i posted here.  \\n\\nTNot looking for responses or sympathy.  Just had to get it all out.  Thx.My relationship with my b/f was not going well so I split with him to work on my relationship with my ex (who I was still in love with).  Three days later my ex was killed in an accident.  \\n\\nThis online schooling thing really is not working for me.  I just do not have the self-discipline.  I am so far behind on my uni courses that I am considering dropping out.\\n\\nMy flat-share left, leaving me with all the bills (it is only my name on the lease) and I can not even work because of quarantine.  If I lose the flat I will have no alternative but to drop out of uni and go home where mom and dad will be arguing as usual, still no jobs available and where I can not live as I want to.  \\n\\nI can not see any positives anywhere.The pain that is inside is being held back by a wall.\\n\\nThe wall is so high it holds everything in\\n\\nThe wall is so strong nothing can get out\\n\\nThe wall is a blanket staving off the outside weather\\n\\nThe wall is stifling but it protects\\n\\nIt protects too well and all feeling is a vague memory\\n\\nIf the wall falls the pain floods\\n\\nLIke a horrible wave it can not be held at bay anymore\\n\\nLIke a swollen river crashing and dragging it drags you under\\n\\nThe pain fills your lungs\\n\\nYou try and swallow it but its still there\\n\\nThe pressure on your chest is unbearable and so heavy\\n\\nyou are sure you will never breathe again\\n\\nYou give up\\n\\nThen the wall rises once more and its stronger\\n\\nPain is once again held back\\n\\nEverything is held back\\n\\nI am so numbit is better to be on here, than speaking into the void I guess..\\nI am going to be 20 in 5 days, it does not feel like I should be this old though. I have sworn to end my life on my 18th birthday ever since I was 11. But that day came and went...I did not have the courage to do it. So ever since then it is been this weird limbo state of life...what now? I did not expect I would ever make it here. I did not prepare myself for this portion of life. I have never had a job, never really been on my own, and I feel life my “life” needs to start. I do not know how to do that though....I have no one really. I do not even know who I am. I am not supposed to be here any longer. It hurts so much. I want this infinite sadness to end. \\nThanks for reading, if you didNauseous, a headache, and having acid reflux since last night. I did not sleep good at all. I feel like absolute shit and I do not even want to be at work. Kill me plsI am a 30-year-old man with a B.A. in education and teaching, my major is citizenship and sociology. I graduated from Uni at the top of my class, two years ago and had a promising future. But my life got messy as soon as I graduated; From a successful, sociable person, a person whom people cherish and appreciate and love, I have become different at 180 degrees.\\n\\n1. My mom got sick, was hospitalized for two months and I moved to here home to help her. Than she moved back and I needed to stay for another couple of months until the goverment gave her someone to care of her.\\n2. I was diagnosed with chronic depression (my problem is not the diagnosis but the consequences of it: now my medical records are stained and I will probably not be able to get private medical insurance, take a mortgage and buy a home and have to declare in any workplace that requires a medical confidentiality waiver that I have depression) .\\n3. I made a mistake and admited to psycaetrist that I smoked cannabis and other things a few years ago and now its registered fact at my medical record. And now I am afraid that i will have to addmit it to insurance companies and employers for the rest of my life.\\n4. I thought I took a short break to help my mom and she recovered but I got lost.\\n\\nI had a very promising future, a bachelor\\'s degree, honors, volunteerism, a good past, I had the qualities of a leader, and I could live a good, good life. I come from a very poor family and I was hoping I could get out of poverty. I am afraid of my future, my parents will have nothing to bequeath to me, my parents live on rent and I am afraid that if my life goes on I will be an aging homeless and without a wife and children and I am anxious for the future.\\n\\n\\xa0All my life, I took care of myself and built myself without the help of anyone. With money no one could help me or help me, only I promoted myself and was proud of myself for it.\\n\\nI already want to find a job and develop a career, but I am ashamed of my last two years. How do I explain that I did not work and was unemployed for 2 years! Whole 24 months? How do I protect myself? I am very worried because I do not think any self-respecting institution will take a 30-year-old who has not worked for two years? I would be happy to advise.I went to work this morning and my older co worker said do you do you have a part time job ? i said no. And he started saying \"When i was your age i worked 3 jobs\" secretly saying how much of a loser i am. and it is true i am lazy and a loser i barely work one job. I just wish i had enough money to be free.Depressed since I am 8 yo (dad beating the shit out of me and my brothers, being really mean and my mom never cared bc my dad has the money, got raped got raped when I was 6yo and shit, looked ugly af so i got bullied for this during my whole scholarity, and I am weird), I have always been negative, and I have always hated everything but I never realised it was a problem until now.  I am just a ball of hate, frustrated of everything because I hate my life and myself, , I hate being like that but this is anorched deep within me and I feel like I can not change, I had some friends (not a lot...) when I was in High school, but I just kept a few of them, and now I am at university, I am 20 and I can not really make new friends, I guess it is because I am too toxic, I am a loner so I would not probably go out with them but just knowing that some people like me would give me a little bit of self-confidence, but I guess I am too bad of a person to have friends which is the main problem here. \\n\\nI feel like on the outside I am a hateful piece of shit but insidide I am quite kind, I do not like hurting people anything like that. \\n\\nBy the way I am french, so sorry for the bad english and if you are american our uni are much more individuals than yours.Please?\\n\\nI do not have anyone to tell so I guess you guys are all I have got, to be honest I prefer it that way.\\n\\nToday I got up before noon, got dressed and actually brushed my teeth (something I have had trouble with) and opened my curtains.\\n\\nMy agoraphobia has always stopped me leaving the house but now quarantine is doing it for me. But I am happy I did something.\\n\\nI am still lacking motivation to shower, self care has always been difficult and I am still debating whether I should eat. Kind of disappointed. \\n\\nI am happy for myself.\\n\\nI hope you are doing well, too. Stay inside :)\\n\\nEdit: grammar mistakesOver the past years, I have been gradually being emotionally numb. The things I used to love, I do not anymore. it is like I forgot how to love. Not just that I do not feel sadness or happiness.  People think that I am sad on days, but no I am not. it is just that I kinda do not feel emotions anymore.The bar is buzzing. Camera flashes are bouncing off the bottles behind the bar. A stack of speakers are shaking with the sonic treats of the top billboard hits. The stool under men feels like it was sharpened by Vlad.\\n\\nA pretty girl is chirping from the stool next to me while flipping her hair between her fingers, but I can only watch the door to the bar. Somewhere out there is some one worth talking to. Whoever it is, they sure as hell are not in this place. They are not dancing on the hardwood floor. They are not throwing back mixed drinks, trying to recapture the carefree moments of youth. They are out there, somewhere. Doing what? I wish I knew.\\n\\nI stand. I leave the bar. The warmth of my bar stool made evident by the cool air now making me overly aware of my own backside. I dust myself off. How long was I sitting in that bar. It does not matter. I am out. I am walking. I am searching the night. I knew I could not stay with those people, nice as they were. I have to find my own kind. The people that wake at night.I feel no passion for anything. My interests have slipped away the longer I have been depressed. I used to want to be a doctor. I used to dream about getting married and finding someone to love me for me. I do not truly want anything. No short term or long term goals. Nothing to motivate me. I wake up to get through the day and get to the end goal- being able to lay in bed and sleep again.I am sure a lot of us are in this situation, but anyone else about to snap?  \\n\\n\\n1- I do not care about isolation, I tend to be a lone wolf anyways, not having to deal with people in person is fantastic.  \\n\\n\\n2- I am very very very close to putting a bullet in my skull. So here in Canada we have something called EI ( employment insurance ) and CERB.   \\n\\n\\nI have spent the better part of Oct onwards (Until around March) being unable to work due to a shoulder and ankle injury. I went into Jan telling myself that I can finally work again and not starve myself each month, then all this bs hit.  \\n\\n\\nNow because I did not work, I am not eligible for either the CERB or EI. Ditto for 100\\'s in my situation, students etc.   \\n\\n\\n3- I have lost track of how many things I have punched this last few weeks. I know my knuckles are bruised up and me usually being civil and patient and friendly, has gone off the deep end and is about ready to put said bullet in my head. As a bonus, my counselor ( who is amazing ) can not work due to all this shit and it will be a very long time till I find someone like her again. \\n\\n  \\nSo who is with me and wants to completely snap? Our respective government have shown they do not care about certain people, so why should we abide by their bs and stuff when we are the ones getting fucked over?For so long I have felt so empty. Nothing in my life seems to give any worth, nothing feels like it matters. \\n\\nI get a girlfriend, I still feel empty. I get friends, I still feel empty. I try and work on myself, AND I STILL FEEL EMPTY. \\n\\nThe worst part of it is the anger though. I feel so angry at the world. Everyone is so stubborn and selfish. No one cares about each other anymore, maybe they never did. They do not treat me with respect, they do not treat others with respect. All they seem to respect is themselves. I swear to god I am going to snap one of these days. \\n\\nWhen I was younger I used to think I was always the one that was wrong. I was the pathetic one, the stupid one, the weak one who would never amount to anything of worth. After years of this crap I am done with it all. I am not what is wrong, the world is what is wrong. Have we all gone crazy or something?! \\n\\nAll life is, is building insecurities in the weak people, tricking them into thinking their lives will actually amount to something of value when they achieve what they are missing out on. My whole life people made fun of me because I could not get a girlfriend. Then when I was finally able to get over my social anxiety and talk to girls it did not even fill that goddamn hole in me! Everyone is awful, absolute fucking garbage. I am too, but at least I can see it. \\n\\nLately this desire has been growing in my mind. Thinking about what it would be like to have so much power that you can literally end everyone all at once. So many pathetic lives thankfully put to waste in a second. that is all they are, just trash.I do not think any other method holds the same reliability,  ease and speed of a gunshot to the head.\\n\\nSure it can go wrong, but so can the other ways and none are as simple as just pulling your finger a little.\\n\\nHanging is so gruesome and does not look quick, and what if you get it wrong? The beam the rope is attached to snaps? So embarrassingHello.\\n\\nI have noticed a lot of differences between 15 year old me & 19 year old me. I know as we grow up our perceptions, views & thoughts also tend to change, but I do not think mine falls into that category of \\'change\\'.\\n\\n When I was younger, I was very ambitious, confident, determined & I knew what I wanted. Now, it is the exact opposite. I do not want to do anything, I do not have any interests and I can not help but think how meaningless life is & how much I hate being the person I am. I just feel like I do not deserve the life I have, it is too good for someone like me to live it. I always feel like a burden to people & I feel like everyone hates me (not that anyone ever said anything). I feel like they just treat me well because they are stuck with me & there is nothing they can do about it.\\n\\n\\nMy brother had studied psychiatry & he was the one whom I could talk to openly. However, he told me not to label myself under those big words. So I have stopped talking to him about it.\\n\\n\\n A day will not pass without thinking about death & how everything would have been better if I had never existed. I used to beat myself up, but I have stopped because my body is now used to the pain. Also, I can not feel sympathy nor empathy anymore. I do not miss anyone, I do not love any one, the only emotions I feel are anger & disappointment. So it is hard for me to connect with people & I am very isolated, like I get introvertion but mine has passed the line, I could not even attend my brother\\'s wedding because I was afraid to do something stupid & embarrass him & afraid of people judging me. On top of that, whenever I feel a tiny bit happy I feel guilty because I feel like a loser like me does not deserve to be happy. \\n\\n\\nSo please let me know if there is something wrong with me or I am fine & just making this up. because I genuinely can not tell if this is really happening to me or it is all in my head. Is this normal or I am just overreacting?Since birth i was given away, the only girl to my mother. She kept my brothers. I was raised with different types of people, family, to strangers & even friends. It was horrible! My upbringing was AWFUL, mentally, emotionally, sexual abuse, abused.  Nobody loved me. I ended up with my 1st child @ the age of 16. I did not know what I was doing, thought I was in love forever, til he cheated on me when our son was 3 months old! I threw him out of my life & moved on to an unstable mother & found another guy to love, I gave birth to our daughter. Her father was crazy, abused me most times well pregnant, ran away from him with my kids @ the age of 17. His family took me to court for my son & our daughter, they spoke lies about me, they wanted me to stay with the crazy son. They found me & my kids were ripped away like a lit match stick! I am more lost than anything at this point, I am trying to do right for me but everytime I failed because I did not care no more. Drinking & smoking weed made me happy, help drown out the pain! 2yrs later I am 19yrs old, I met a guy who is 16yrs old. I could not help but make myself known to his presence @ a course we both attended. We eventually made out & stuck together for 10yrs & in that 10yrs we had 5 kids. My life had changed dramatically from LOST to settled, I gave birth to his 1st child but my 3rd. After hrs in labour, we had him for 30mins till his passing, the most difficult part of my life. Losing a child in my opinion is worse than the abuse & rape I have had to endure. A week after his passing, the father had gone back to work, he did not cry or realize he had gone. 1st day @ work he was hospitalized, fell from a 2 story building shattering his right arm. After all of this, he started to abuse me so bad, I still stayed with him & gave birth to the rest of his 5. He was in & out of jail constantly for abuse, I was having to deal with Child Youth & Families until 1 day they we are uplifted because I let him back into our lives knowing he was abusive & a high risk to almost killing me so many times. I put my kids at risk, even with drinking around them. I have never known what LOVE or how to trust the person you love. I am very hidden with how I can start something out of nothing, the jealousy towards another female or anyone getting close to the one I love is A NO. My upbringing I blame for that. After them been uplifted in 2014, I am definitely drowning in SHIT, do not care for nothing or myself. He ends up in jail a few months later, 2yrs he is doing. I am on the outside waiting for him like a dumb cunt, in 2016 I found someone on facebook. was not looking for love, he was someone that attended the same school as me back when I was 13. We end up talking little bits, he started to get at me on a daily its unbelievable how I am here 5yrs later with him lol. he is born on the same day as the one in jail, in different years. we are also 3 days apart on our birthdays. He came across as a narcissist, It was unbelievably difficult for me. I found so much connection to this guy, I could not let go. He was not my type but the bond was strong. He has a daughter, I have never been in a relationship with a guy who had a child, so it took a toll on me to accept it. The fact I had to make room for someone that he showed a huge amount of love for, made me feel jealous. After spending time with her, I started to accept her more, I actually loved been there for her because I did not have any of my own kids with me. She gave me hope to motivate myself to see my kids. 3yrs into our relationship we had a son my 8th child! His daughter went to live with her mother, it is best she did, she was depressed with us. I could not be that mother figure to her cos she loved her own mother. Today is the 15th of April 2020, my eldest boy will be 18 this month. My 8th child has autism, I am still with his father. I am 34 turning 35 in August this year, I am heavily depressed, never spoke to anyone about my troubled life. Drunk it away, laughed it off & forgave so many that did me wrong. I suffer from anxiety attacks, I feel as if I am slowly dying. I am too young to die & I have so many things I want to do as a individual women, I am highly motivated but I know my partner will feel insecure about me wanting to get out there on social media. I gave up smoking in October 2019, never have I quit smoking before thanks to my major ANXIETY ATTACK! I have also cut back on drinking, thanks to my trip to the hospital with a liver issue. Now I am plain, with so many things I want to do. I have low self esteem due to weight gain, my confidence has stepped up to 60% my inside though feels tired, for years I lost my purpose & myself. These last few months I have been searching for me, I have found bits & pieces. I do not want to waste anymore of my life doing what others want of me or giving others what I think they want! I get to see all my children (heart is relieved) reducing stress. Lazy, which is a good thing, I suffered & still suffer from OCD. I have major health issues but tests say I am healthy. It could be my mind overthinking. I am praying someone or anyone could talk to me & tell me it is ok. I often think of the homeless & all those suffering in other countries that are asking for miracles. If I had any kind of high power, I would definitely do my best to save as many as I can. Its who I am as a person, caring for others even if they committed a crime I can not hate. I pretend to be tough out there but hurting any living thing breaks my heart. I hate that I can not hate the people who raped me, it makes me hate myself so much. I am a follower but I know deep down i can be a good leader, if I found who I am. Thanks for letting me share my NOVEL of doom. Never shared a briefing of my life before with strangers! Oh well I feel it may help since I could not speak to a counselor due to my anxiety attacks.I posted to my various social media about my depression. For me, this was kind of like a victory letter. it is me saying that I am not ashamed of my depression and I am getting help. I do not want it to control my life. No matter what is going on, we have to have hope that something better is coming along. Right?\\n\\nFor reference, this is what I posted:\\n\\n\\nDepression. it is a bitch. \\nIt took me to the brink of life and death in 8th grade and now again when I am 21 years old. It was not supposed to be like this and I felt disappointed in myself for so long for not being able to “fix myself”. For those who have reached out to me, thank you. You may think that saying hi was insignificant, but your notification was literally the only light in my room sometimes. And those who did not, how could you have known. I have always been ashamed of my depression. I have always tried to hide it behind smiles and jokes. It made me feel better momentarily. But I always ended up feeling alone because I had no one that knew the real me. And I am tired of that. It took a lot of courage saying this, and even more courage to get help. But thanks to the wonderful people supporting me I am able to stand strong. Starting today, I am going to be living fully and un-apologetically me. It took me a long way to get here... But I am happy to say that for once in my life, I am looking forward to tomorrow.This could be difficult to explain but everytime I get into a spiral of depression my mind makes every day conversation/interaction almost impossible, not through want of not trying but because somehow your brain has completely shut off that ability.\\n\\nHas anyone experienced this situation where their whole vocabulary is restricted to just a select few words and feel as though their brain has just shut down?\\nP.s. even when I try and get into a conversation my sentences are muddled (further reinforcing this idea my brain is giving up?)Hey people, here\\'s a thing I wrote tonight about my... \\'situation\\' I guess? it is my first post, so sorry if it is bad. I hope to help anyone else who feels the same to not feel alone. \\n\\n\\nI do not know...\\n\\nI do not know. Sometimes I know and other times I am not really sure. Is this whole thing just fake? Did my brain create this story for me to believe so that I can feel some sense of certainty, or that I can feel that I am \\'special\\' and people should pity me? Do I cut only so I can think \"only someone with depression would hurt themselves on purpose, right? So I must have depression, right? Right?\". is it lying to me, like everyone says it does? Sometimes I am happy, briefly, and then it reminds me of everything and my smile fades. No one notices, though. But those were genuine smiles. So I can not have depression if I am smiling, right? If I felt happiness? Oh, someone did notice. They asked me if I was sad, and trapped and scared in the moment, I said \"no one will ever know..?\" stupid. Fucking stupid. I did not want to lie but I could not say the truth. I am such an idiot. that is literally such a stupid thing to say. And then my dad noticed. Trapped me in my room and asked if I was OK. I said \"yeah, I am fine, I am always like this.\" so stupid. But I did not know if I have depression, so what if it turned out that I did not and people laughed at me and judged me and called me a crybaby and a wimp behind my back? I am only 13, so I have nothing to worry about right? Nothing to be sad about? It would destroy me. Because it is true. And that is what hurts. I do not know who I am, what I am supposed to do. Just school, and feeling nothing. Wake up, stress. Go to bed, emptyness. No emotion. Just stress. Brief happiness. Sadness. Self-hatred. The feeling of being lost. I want to cry but if I do people will hear me. Fuck. I am a wimp. A loser. No one actually likes me, how could they? WHY would they? So many questions. No answer. I will never get answers. it will constantly be this feeling of being trapped. A cycle. No motivation, but I have to act OK, otherwise they will give me that piteous look and ask me questions I do not want to answer. Because if I do not have depression, they will hate me and say I just want attention. they will hate me more than they already do. But I laugh, so I am okay. Right?\\n\\nI... I do not know.\\n\\nIf you got this far... Thanks. It really means a lot to me.I did not realise till now that school was making my depression and anxiety SO much worse. Here\\'s the pattern that made me realise:\\n\\nSchool year starts - suddenly I think about suicide every night as I try to sleep\\n\\nSchool holidays start - suicidal thoughts become less overwhelming and less frequent\\n\\nFrom the FIRST DAY school goes back - intense daily suicidal thoughts return...\\n\\nI always knew school was having a very bad effect on my mental health, but never put anymore emphasis on it than other things that because me stress and depression like relationships, the state of the world, etc...\\n\\nThe sad thing is even when I am not at school and have relaxed thoughts I am still not happy. There are NO circumstances in life that will bring me happiness.\\n\\n(First post on reddit btw)i do not necessarily think I am evil either... but i think my overall contribution to the world is negative (or at least not exactly great) i say stupid shit... i know I have hurt people. I have had so many friends that treated me like shit and I am starting to wonder. am i the issue? have i been the problem this entire time? i find myself becoming more bitter by the day... i snap at my boyfriend and I am becoming more and more apathetic about it. i used to feel crippling anxiety about things like this but it feels weirdly okay to accept the fact that I am probably not a good person. I have tried but usually i am more selfish than i am selfless, even though i TRY to help people. i am trying to be better but i find it extremely exhausting and i can not help but be a bitch most of the time quite frankly. but by putting my own interests above everyone else I know it can be shitty to deal with. i fantasize about driving off the cliff by my house all the time... when i finally get my license i think i will do it. it is this great big chasm that probably drops hundreds of feet. it is a nice thought.I do not have purpose or drive or any positive qualities. No one loves me nor will anyone ever love me. They know I do not deserve love. I can not take this emptiness. I am already slowly dying.How the fuck can people think doing this is okay or normal? I just finished working a 15-hour day with a total of ONE TEN MINUTE break at my second job. Open to close. I have only been working two jobs at once for a couple weeks now and it is already draining me and making me want to die even more than I already do.it is my first time really doing this, but I thought it would be best to at least share my feelings. I moved from my hometown and left everything behind. Not possessions, but my relationships that I had cherished so very much. I lost all of my friends, my best friends that I had been through thick and thin with for years, that I called family. But the one that has hit me the worst is the loss of my girlfriend. We broke up because of the long distance between us, and that has made everything so much harder. I have no one, and I do not feel happy in the slightest. All I feel is just pain, and her and frustration because not only am I such a failure, but I am all alone. I am all alone and being alone is so depressing for me. I think of suicide a lot, especially since I keep all my thoughts to myself and never vent to anyone. I miss what I had, and I wish I never had to be in pain so much, all I want to be is happy. That all I want.I keep relapsing because of this and I literally can not help it either, people always tell me to stop dwelling or worrying but do they realize I can not do it? it is too hard for me. I am basically having relapses because of a thing that is out of my control and it is so painful. Nobody understands that I can not just simply live in the present. I wish all my suffering could just end. I do not want to die, but I do not want to keep living the way I am living but I can not do that. it is a never ending loop.I feel like I am fighting myself and loosing. My head is just above the surface but I have essentially been drowning for years now. And no one gets it seriously, and even if someone did, I know no one can help.  I have been up and down but the main thing that has happened trough these years of sadness and self doubt is the fact I have slowly been disappearing. And not so much in other peoples lives, altho that too, but in my own mind. I remember less, feel less, know less, am myself less, have less hope,  zero will and energy. I feel hopeless, and not even in the same cliche way that everyone around me seems to see, but in my core. I hate it. I have come to truly discus myself. Bit of background, I am a 24 year old girl (altho i do not feel like much of anything). I graduated graphic design in 2018. I have a messy but loving family, a home. Finally I think I found a decent guy that loves me, as oppose to a sea full of assholes I have been with so far. As a little kid I was pretty shy, and a smartass, which as you can assume lead to a fair amount of bullying. I rarely had real friends. We moved a lot. So I assume it makes sense I was an introverted kid, alone, in the books etc. But I grew up thinking I had it, the courage to shrug shit off, the brain to see above and beyond the little petty world I lived in, and big brave heart ful of love and dreams, sure I was going to grow out of the shit and show everyone I was actually great, and just rock on. Reality is, that kid in me feels so disappointed, it gets hard to breathe let alone stop myself from crying. And my mind just keeps on rambling and going over and over the same shit, while I slowly lose every pixel of what I wished I was.I am getting worse.  it is like everything leads me more and more to thinking about how the pain is personal, permeant and pervasive.  I cannot see light at the end of the tunnel.  The more I go there the more worse it gets.\\n\\n(Note to self identify triggers)Hey everyone,\\nI am someone struggling with depression since five years and have been lurking in this sub since a year or so. I have figured I will not be able to help anyone since I am busy enough with my own thoughts, but I might as well post something interesting on here. Depression is a disease that tends to affect people with above-average intelligence, due to the fact that smarter people often overthink and/or start questioning themselves, life or even existence itself. \\nI made a playlist and wondered why are we so obsessed with sad music, when listening to happy music would be the most logical thing to do. \\nFor anyone interested, my playlist consists of sad songs I listen to when times are difficult.\\nLink:\\n https://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVw\\n\\nFirst of all I got to say that music is not a cure for depression and can even affect you in a negative way. The Playlist is just somthing I wanted to share.\\n\\nSo. Why do we like sad music?\\n\\nWhen we listen to music we feel understood. We can see a glimpse of ourselves in the artist or song, that conveys the same emotions we feel. We feel better about our situation when we believe that someone else has experienced something similar and understands exactly how we feel. More importantly it validates our thoughts and makes us feel human and normal. At the same time, it allows listeners to bring their own negative emotions to the surface and vent them out, thereby reducing tension and stress.\\n\\nWhy do we hate listening to happy music?\\n\\nAs stated above, happy music would be the first logical thought at first, but often we do end up feeling worse than if we had not listened to happy songs. The best way to put it would be to compare both happy and sad with humans. The sad one is the understanding one who went through the same and is trying to console you, while the happy one is a annoying guy who always smiles at us and tells us to just cheer up and be happy.\\n\\nWhy do we like sad songs even when we are not sad?\\n\\nWho in their right mind would choose a song that could heavily mess with their mood when there are happy alternatives out there?\\nSimply put is happy music often boring and fake. We as humans can not feel happiness for a extended period of time and get annoyed after a few songs.\\nSad music is more moving and we connect to sad, romantic or even angry topics.\\n\\nEffects of sad music on us:\\n\\n\"One might suppose that people\\xa0become pessimistic when they are sad; however, one\\xa0research study\\xa0proves that people are actually more realistic when they are sad. This is due to a phenomenon called depressive realism. Compared with happiness, sadness has been observed to encourage more detail-oriented thinking and less judgment bias in people. Listening to sad music is believed to induce depressive realism, encouraging more realistic assessments of the likelihood of certain outcomes.\"\\n\\n- scienceabc.com\\n\\nThere is actually no point in posting this but I just felt like it. If you want to you can read more into the science part of it on scienceabc.com\\nIf you are looking for a playlist, check mine out and please leave feedback because I want it to be good.\\n\\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/64nfYNNQX1XoxPi8OiX7yZ?si=spM8oepXRt-g2t3jWwwiVwWell.. the dream was actually a good one. It was waking up that was bad. I dreamt that my old best friend was still alive. He was at his moms house and he had only faked his suicide. The dream was SO vivid, it was so real, when I woke up it felt more like a memory from yesterday than a dream. I knew it was a dream thought and it send me into a spiral of unanswered depression questions. Did he mean to die? Could I have prevented it? Did he want help? Etc\\n\\nI wish I had a time machine.when i wake up tomorrow it is going to be rough. my brain has used up a significant portion of its gaba reserves through phenibut. ugh. i am annoyedSometimes I just want to do my homework, but then what is the point of it anyway if I am going to kill myself later anyway? Then I realize I am too much of a coward to kill myself because I know I would be tortured in hell because of everything I did. I want to talk to my friends about my depression, but I do not want to act needy or burden them to the point where they leave me.It feels like I am floating through life. If that makes sense. When I walk it feels like I am not in my body but floating above it. It feels like a connection that is almost fading. The world is blurry. Especially when I am finally outside.I tried, healing myself, helping others and all that shit but i just do not understand, wtf am i doing wrong? Everyday\\'s getting worst and worst, i become more numb, soulless and apathetic. I just want this to end, only my doc knows how many meds I have tried to get better, everyone thinks depression is a flu or a fever that with popping more pills it will go away, no it is not how it works i just wish people just stop being assholes, ig it is a good thing I am numb, cus at least i do not have to worry about anything or anyone hurting me. I am truly done, just a breathing flesh, no purpose no future no dream nor hope, just waiting for death.Because of depression I have been struggling with discipline and motivation in college for a while now. I have already changed from a double major to a single major because of them. On january/february, after more than a year of monthly therapy, daily medication, self improvement books vids and articles, and a lot of trial and error, I really was getting the hang of it. Going to all of my classes, studying daily, not procrastinating. For the first time since I entered college, I felt good about how I was handling things.\\n\\nBoom, pandemic, quarantine. No more classes. I had no crutch anymore, no calendar to follow. No more sport to vent. No more therapy. Things went to shit quickly. \\n\\nI am several weeks behind in almost every class. I have missed a lot of assignments and classes because I just was not aware. My brain feels foggy once again. My father told me that if this semester does not go well, he is going to get me out of college and put me to work. I should be so determined and full of activity but my brain does not seem to care anymore. This is just a shitty situation overall.it is 3 in the morning once again.\\nI am up and overthinking like I always do.\\nMy patience with myself is running thin.\\nI hope that I do not completely destroy you.\\nI am no angel I love to sin.\\nThe devil has something in me he is beginning to brew.\\nYou will not see it coming till only then.\\nIt will leave you cold, alone and blue.\\n\\nit is 3 in the morning another night.\\nI wonder where these evil dreams come from.\\nMy angels and sleep paralysis are putting up a fight.\\nYou sill stay with me even though you are completely succumb.\\nThe room goes dark but my head turns on a light.\\nMy whole body goes numb from the tip of my tongue.\\nAll of me is screaming as I lose my sight.\\nI am tied down to this bed but I need to run.it is a weird feeling, but most of the time the feelings and emotions during depression do not make senseSome nights I am really struggling not to take a bottle of pills and slice up my whole body and just die. I hate myself so very much and I have just come to the realization nobody gives a shit about me and nobody ever will give a shit. I am always the happy one helping others and talking and cheering them up but in reality i want to hang myself. The urges to cut are extreme and I just want to slice open every inch of my skin until all i feel is the sting and pain. I get bad urges to the point where i can feel it on my skin so i dig my nails into my arms trying to alleviate myself with the pain but its not enough. I need to cut.I hate myself so goddamn much. Why am I such an awful personstill lonely as shit the voices are worse now and now i see things and i want to die even moreI have lost my faith in everything and I reached my lowest point in depression again. I just can not see meaning in anything and I can not see hope in the future it is all like a deep dark tunnel without an exit. I have been depressed for a really long time and I am tired of living like this. what is the point of living if you are feeling dead inside every day? what is the point of living when you are alone, not good enough and will never be good enough no matter how hard you try\\nI wish I was brave enough to end my life but I am scared of attempting suicide and failing again but in the same time I just feel so suicidal and I can not go through life like this anymore. Bro I can not take it, I really can not, I swearDoes anyone else’s family taunt and bully you about your depression and self harmSo I have always had trouble sleeping. Whenever I try to sleep I see, hear, feel, and smell things that are not there. Voices tell me that someone is in my house or they impersonate family or friends. Hands and bugs start bothering me, and I start seeing figures and shapes. \\n\\nBecause it is been getting worse I have not slept right in almost a week. it is 5AM and I just went downstairs to get a drink and I swear to christ there was someone in my living room. I saw them, I heard them, but the moment they were no longer in my line of sight they vanished. Now I am hearing shit and paranoid, and I am starting to feel like I am just fucking losing it.\\n\\nThis place makes me miserable and I have every chance to just disappear to somewhere else but I do not take it.\\n\\nSorry if this makes no sense I just need to put it out thereI feel like no matter what my depression is always going to remind me of how much I want to dieLife is a cycle. You have a good day after a myriad of bad ones or vice versa. Just logically, it does get better. But, with the same logic, it gets worse.\\n\\nHappiness is not eternal. Neither is sadness. Life is living with the constant cycle of good to bad and bad to good. \\n\\nSo then, is life worth living just for the good ones?\\n\\nI do not know.I hate school\\n\\nSo I randomly started thinking about when I was in Year 7 ( In UK, currently Year 10). But anyway I have low functioning autism which sucks incredibly( I will get onto that later), so I had been at this pretty good school that worked you pretty hard and the week before half term I was basically just talking with my new friend of about 2 months, and we were just joking around on the bus when I lightly slapped him on the face, anyway I thought nothing of it and we continued talking until we got to school. When we got there though a Year 12 I think came up to me and said why did you hit ____, which I was confused by and basically just went to class. Later in the second class of the day the lower school headmaster( or whatever weird title he had) came in and took me out of class, and I was completely confused, but he said that _____ had gone to the nurses with a red mark on his face( he was not in my class btw) which I knew was total bullshit as I hardly touched his face but then as I have low functioning autism it basically means I lose complete function over my body and I said I wanted to kill myself and the teacher was complete shit at handling it.\\n\\nFast forward a few months and I basically developed anger management, depression, etc. and I was still at the school getting in for about 2 hours a week and feeling like utter crap. \\n\\nThen just before the first Christmas of Year 7 and I moved to another school which was honestly great, I mean I had loads of friends (actually good friends this time) and I was seeing a counsellor at the school and I felt slightly better about myself. Then after two months the counsellor, who was fully confidential, literally reported my dad to the local council as he was mentally abusive to me and I needed to tell someone so I told them, so thanks to that shit show I lost all confidence in that school and moved on.\\n\\nI then had a few day trials at schools and did a month on an online school which was terrible.\\n\\nThen in the Easter term of Year 8 I went to another school, for a term long trial, and I enjoyed that again and it was ok apart from the end of term when it felt like no one cared about me and I basically just walked out one day ( because I wanted to go home so I went to the office were they were supposed to call my mum, they refused and so for pretty much 2 hours I sat on the sofa by the office until I just could not be fucked and left) then on that same my mum went for a meeting and the school said they would not take me back next year and I cried and was incredibly depressed for about a week.\\n\\nI have now found a tiny collage with 6 people in a class that is literally meant for me as I was the first student there, and while it has its ups and downs it pretty good and I have actually been at one school for almost two years.\\n\\nHonestly though just thinking about how one person saying that I punched them has basically ruined 3 years of my life and possibly will affect my adult life, it just makes me annoyed and depressed which is why I felt I had to get it out of my system.\\n\\nHopefully this is the right place to post it, but if not can someone tell me what the suitable subreddit is.I feel like nothing in my life is going the way I want to and I know for a fact nothing will for me. Heck I am just 17 I have not really tasted what the world is like, but so far what I have experience is really something I do not want to be apart of. I have felt like like happiness is not a thing for me and will not be. At this point I think being happy is fake. I have been through so many hard days having nothing good planned or wanting to chase anything that would make someone happy. I really do not know if I can pull my shit together and get through myself.I really attack myself and destroy my own happiness. \\n\\nI am worthless. \\n\\nI compare myself to others so I can put myself down. \\n\\nI keep my head down and my voice shut so I become a walking ghost. \\n\\nEverything is wrong with me. \\n\\nOther people learn from their mistakes. I tend to repeat them. \\n\\nAs the seasons change, I stay the same. \\n\\nI am weak physically, mentally, and emotionally. \\n\\nI want to be worth something. \\n\\nI am sorry for the way I have been acting. \\n\\nAll the moments in my life led to this. \\n\\nExcuses are half the things that come from my mouth. \\n\\nYou are disgusting. You are fat. You are worthless. No one would want someone with self-harm scars. You are damaged goods. Broken, and not physically. You complain about the dumbest shit and you are always ready to attack, even though you do not need to. You self pity because it is easier to accept than the truth that you are a dumb cunt. \\n\\nI want to ruin the opportunities before me so I have something to complain about. \\n\\nI will never be satisfied with who I am. \\n\\nMy emotions should not rule me but they seem to be both king and queen. \\n\\nI liked to be walked on, overlooked, picked last. It reminds me of who I am.\\n\\nMaybe I just was not meant to be in the end. \\n\\nI wish I could learn but you can not teach an old dog new tricks.\\n\\nMy brain tears itself apart without my help.i would be cute, fat (and not care), and get all the cuddles and attention that i want. instead I am stuck in my disgusting, depressed and anxious body. I have struggled with depression and anxiety throughout my entire life. i just turned 21 and i do not understand how I am supposed to keep pushing through it. my only relief is drugs and alcohol. I am a musician and full time student and i am under constant pressure to perform well and every season is full of gigs that i need to play and practices i have to be at. I am so exhausted and sick of my life and i desperately want to be someone else. i do not even feel like my mind is connected to my body anymore. my voice sounds disembodied, my reflection is not me.I am on the edge and I just really want a friend I can talk to to get my mind off thingsFeel weakness and want just go to bed and wait for next day in hopes it will be better. But cannot. Now with tinder fre passport nned to search waifu in all world, and after 100 000 females swiped left and 100 right got only 3 matches, but their potebtial in becoming more is very doubtfull. Everything looks so hopeless, and that is reason of weaknessA couple months ago I was having a rough time with life and I was getting to be super sad. I thought nobody could love me and I always felt alone even when I was with my friends and family. Then one day this girl texted me and she thought I was cute, but I guess I got too attached to her and drove her away and she did not like me anymore after a few days of talking. After messing that up I was super depressed and wanted to kill myself because I felt like I had no place in this world anymore. Then I got a text from that girls friend and she said she wanted to talk because she felt bad that her friend did that to me. I have been talking to that girl ever since. About a month ago I found out that this girl really likes me. it is been amazing and I have actually felt loved for the first time in years. But for the last couple weeks I have had this overwhelming feeling that she is not going to be there forever. I really like her and want to keep her around but I am worried that she will leave and I will fall back into the deep pit she pulled me out of. She saved my life and I do not think I could let her go if she left me.was having fun with fiancé, I took it too far, instantly ignored. said sorry so many times, still ignored. I am sorry. Please say something to me. I can not take it. Please I am so sorry. I did not mean to hurt you I was just having fun I have had a few drinks I am so sorry I did not know I pulled your hair a little too hard you have liked that before but that does not mean I get to do it whenever it is my fault I am sorry I am sorry I am sorry either hate me and leave or talk to me please talk to me I can not handle it I am the worst I hate myself I will kill myself if you tell me to please just let me kill myself please please please just say I can just tell me it is ok to end my life promise to take care of my mom and tell me it will be ok without me I can not handle this anymore even when you love me I can not handle it I will kill myself eventually just let me do it sooner rather than later please please please...just got to sleep it off. Go away in the morning sadness.I can not seem to believe my father is not here anymore. Even if we were never close because of things that happened between me, my mom and siblings, these last few years I tried to change and just let God guide him to a better path. We became sort of close the past 2 years. But I never got to say I forgive you. Never gave him a hug without feeling awkwardness now I find myself crying every time I remember all the promises we made together and knowing he is not opening our house door anymore. He was not the best father in the world but he was the only father God gave me. I tried to be his friend...he was so lonely and I felt sad for him. His actions made no one want to get close to him but I felt bad for him even if for years I resented him...I always felt bad. I miss him. \\n\\nI still hope this is all a bad dream.Does anyone else feel awful when you accidentally have an okay day?A bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. I just feel like I have nothing and no one to live for. I have been really struggling lately. The people I count on to come and talk to when I feel like shit just flat out do not answer my texts, so I have stopped bothering texting them. The only girl I have ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. So I stopped texting her as well. No one bothers checking on me so why should I reach out to them? My aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. And my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. I was seeing a therapist but stopped because I could not afford it. They care more about money than the health of their clients. America summed up in one sentence I guess. \\n\\nI dropped out of engineering school in October after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because I just did not want to do it anymore. I was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. I may or may not go back. My student loans are due starting in June which I can not afford. I have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that I never wanted in the first place with money that I do not have. I only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which I much prefer would not pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. I just absolutely fucking hate being told what I can and can not do with my own damn car that I pay for 100% myself. My car is my therapist and my favorite thing that I own. I am working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. I cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it is been a month since quarantine and I can not really even leave my house. can not have a social life. Just feel like I have no one to turn to and I am drowning. Every fucking day and I am just done. \\n\\nI left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. I waited til my family had all gone to bed, then I got in my car and just took off. I drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. I eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. I got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone I felt. I was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when I heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. I knew it was a cop at this point but did not bother trying to hide myself. I just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. He approached with a flashlight and noticed me. Apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. He was a young guy, probably about my age. He asked for my license and registration which I gave him. I would said maybe two words to him at this point, and I think he picked up on the fact that I seemed a bit off. He asked me how I was doing and what I was doing so far from home at this time of night. It was like 1 am at this point. I just said that I needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually I admitted that I had driven up here to kill myself. \\n\\nI thought he was going to freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. He asked why and what was going on in my life. He even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. I had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how I felt like I had no one. He did not interrupt and even put an arm around me. I eventually said I planned to drive my car off this cliff because I was so unhappy. He was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. Apparently he came close to suicide a few times. A quote he said really stuck with me. It was “Sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” And it hit me that that was exactly how I felt. He gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if I needed to talk. We sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. It was so nice to just vent to someone. \\n\\nEventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what I just told him, we both knew he could not leave me there alone for obvious reasons. He walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. He walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. He followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while I got on the entrance ramp. I drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. I never even got his name or badge number. \\n\\nI got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. I snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. I gave no indication to my family that I tried suicide the night before. No one knew that I went out last night. I still have not told them and I do not plan to. They have no idea that I could have died. I called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. He texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. I have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and do not really want to ask. Everyone has at least one secret that they will take to their grave, and this is probably mine. \\n\\nit is a long shot that he will read this but if he does, I do not know what to say to him or how to thank him. His compassion saved my life. it is crazy to think what would have happened if he had taken a different patrol route and had not come along when he did. He deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. I owe him my life. Cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. We would not have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. I do not know if there is a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. I could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. Not a bad idea. Godspeed officer. I will never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.do not know if anyone else shares this same feeling or not. Everyday when the sun sets, I just feel like sinking in darkness. Lonely, hopeless, desperate to quit the depressed feeling. Then I realize this has already been happening for a year already. I sit in front of a computer. When I am tired, I stand up and eat. When I am tired standing, I lie on the bed and imagine myself sinking deeper. Keep wondering if I actually want to survive if I am drowning and falling deep down the dark sea. \\n\\nProbably I still want to be rescued. But unmotivated to make myself survive - when I know there is not going to be anyone coming to rescue. Another tired and sleepless night.I am a freshman in highschool. I hate living idk why. My parents have a good marriage they are not physically abusive or very verbally abusive, I am in the lower middle class, I have a 4.5 GPA,I am 6\\'2\", I play volleyball and basketball, and everything seems fine but I am so fucking depressed.\\nI told my parents that I have not been happy in a long time and they called me out telling me I have no reason to not be happy.\\nI only have a couple of reasons to be sad. The biggest one being my severe ADHD that my parents decided to keep unmedicated and they just told me about this I spent my whole life thinking I was just a piece of shit because my mind would always drift.\\nI drafted up my first suicide not and I feel like I want someone to find it then maybe people would believe I am actually depressed because EVERYONE IN HIGHSCHOOL PRETENDS TO BE DEPRESSED FOR FUCKING ATTENTION. They make it so hard for people like me to come forward. My suicide not talks about everyone that affected my life significantly including a list of nice people and a page on how family never really meant anything to me.\\n\\nPlease if you are not actually depressed do not say you are it is people like that that make me not come forward and people that do not recognize depression as a real conditionit is a lengthy post but hopefully it makes you guys feel better by not realizing you are alone. I am going to make a part 2 as well. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy first mistake was learning to speak, if only I were born a mute. \\n\\nI got used to being made fun of that I started to do it normally in my mind.\\n\\nMy brain is so broken that negativity is my one and only normal.\\n\\nTalentless and below average in a sea of those who will always be better than me. \\n\\nOne mistake can lead to others that feel like a slight burn. I will continue to make them until I am completely engulfed in flames.\\n\\nYesterday was great. Too bad those days are so rare. \\n\\nMy feelings are toys to be played with and then forgotten after some amount of time. \\n\\nMy mood is bound to change in an instant to negativity so that I may be comfortable. \\n\\nDo I conform so easily to others opinions or do I take bits and pieces from others? Either way, they never feel like my own.\\n\\nI want to satisfy those at my own dissatisfaction. \\n\\nWhy are we cursed with lives of self-doubt, contradicting, and hateful thoughts?\\n\\nWanting to always be right about failing, I will sabotage myself if doing well or flat out refuse. What a disgusting creature I am.\\n\\nWhy is that whenever I am happy, depressing, and negative thoughts come by the multitude? Like a woodpecker at a tree, they pick at my brain until they are in and settled. \\n\\nSuicidal ideation was once my full time job. \\n\\nI want to say I am sorry and that it is all my fault, although I am not quite sure what for.\\n\\nwe are all hypocrites to some degree or another. \\n\\nA time for everything, but mine has been mostly sadness. \\n\\nTo believe I was once complete and not broken into tiny little pieces. \\n\\ndo not hate me. I already hate myself. \\n\\nAfter wanting to change for so long, it is finally here. Now that it is, I want nothing more than for it to go away. \\n\\nI was never the lion like I wanted to believe. I am the dog in the corner, whimpering and cold, only wanting to love and be loved back. \\n\\nI can look past others deformities but not my own. \\n\\nI can forgive everyone. I just can not forgive myself. \\n\\nInstead of overcoming my problems, I succumb to them. I want to blame someone for that. But everytime I look for that person, I end up looking in the mirror.\\n\\nNever improving. Always failing. The essence of who I am.TL;DR at the end\\n\\nI just did both the worst and best thing I have done in a long time. 10 months ago I met a girl. I uave never had a better relationship with anyone ever. We never dated, we were just good friends. However, I did develop feelings for her, in fact, she is the first person I have ever been in love with. I had a girlfriend when we met. I decided to dump her to be with this girl. I never shoot my shot because I was too scared to do so and, well, we never became anything more than good friends. 5 months ago she started dating someone. Every other night I have been crying myself to sleep since then. I never stop thinking about her and I tried my best so we would not drift off and stay as friends. Nothing I did worked, and we ended up hardly ever talking, only when she felt like shit. I tried to kill myself again month ago and she called me up. I told her how I felt and she pretty much told me to stop being a dumbass. Today I told her that it would be better if we never talked again, and even after being taken off my meds by my psychiatrist and not needing therapy anymore due to being well, I have not felt this shit in months, yet I know this is better for me\\n\\nTL;DR I was in love with a girl, we drifted apart, tried my best to save the relationship, still fucked it up, told her we should not speak anymore, and even though it hurts like hell, I know it is better for meWhy do I get embarrassed/defensive when people notice I am struggling or ask if I am okay even though I Lowkey want them to notice? Ugh it is so weirdThis lockdown has really been getting to me too. it is been getting to me, even if I am a less cynical of a person now.\\n\\nIt definitely reminds me of my childhood where I had very limited friends since I was sort of this emo nerd who got along with everyone but was never really kept around, no matter how hard I tried. I have had contact with a few of my close friends, but I have been wanting more than the sporadic texts or the very rare phone call. I have been sort of falling into the routine of getting up, writing or drawing, cleaning, reading, studying just for the hell of it, and exercising. My dogs passed away last year, and they were the only reasons why I felt anything and the only reasons why I stayed home after college.\\n\\nI can not ask my family for support since they keep telling me \"millions of people are going through the same thing\". But are those millions of people suffering related to them? No. I get it, people have it worse, but I am allowed to feel the way I feel. I had a lot of time to research my own psyche and why I am the way I am, and it sucks really bad. I miss working so I can distract myself from those thoughts, and the thoughts of returning home feeling like I am not good enough. Feeling like I am a failure for being 25 and not being financially stable enough to make rent in Hawaii, where it costs a fucking kidney and liver to rent a shitty ass apartment and have a car, even with another person. I help out as much as I can at home, but it never feels like enough. I thought I was going somewhere with my life. I had huge plans.\\n\\nThis is the first time in a very long time I have let my feelings out since I always felt like I was being a baby when I did. As long as I can remember, I have kept my feelings to myself because when I was a kid it was always \"do not get upset.\", \"Why are you getting mad for?\", \"there is no reason to be depressed, it is all in your head.\", \"You can not hang out with these decent kids you like because I do not know or like them.\" So as a result, instead of being resilient like I thought I was throughout high school and college, it turns out I have just become an overly-critical, avoidant, closed-off asshole who kept her nose in books instead of trying to make meaningful relationships. I am still trying to work out how to maintain friendships, maintain a relationship, and not distance myself the moment I get too close to anyone. I think I might be so closed off that even words can not help me at this point. Yet, I still miss people.\\n\\nI did not even ask to be born, as ungrateful as it sounds. I thought I was getting better, too. It might have just been my imagination.\"I am extremely attractive\" \"everybody wants me\" \"I am smarter than most people\" \\n\\nIf these conditions are not met, then I feel like I just want to die. Having a huge ego is the only way I can escape my pain. It is quite the opposite of pain. idk what to do. Phenibut makes me feel this way, but I can not take it alot because it can be harmful, but it gives me the illusion that I am strong enough to cope with life. It makes me focus on the good things.After realizing how bad life was getting I was loosing sleep, I thought it was normal and I read about it a lot. After a month after me not being able to sleep I realized this is getting bad. I sleep 5 nights every week and it does not sound that bad but it is horrible considering the days I do sleep I fall asleep at 12.\\n\\nI wake up at 9am and am tired as fuck. I tried lucid dreams and tips on how to fall asleep. I know this might not be the right subreddit or whatever but I do not know how to sleep. Anybody have advice?To begin, I am a 20 something med student. My family is not poor but we are not doing that great either. But due to being in med school I am being exposed to a lot of flexing (both intended and unintended) from my classmates. This is mostly because a lot of the students here have medic parents, and are therefore pretty rich. Cool cars, newest phone, expensive PCs, expensive clothes.\\n\\nNow I do not really care about phones and clothes, but seeing them drive cool cars and play the newest games hurts me deeply, as both of those are big passions of mine. I love cars but my parents can not afford to buy me one, and med school does not leave me time to get a job. I also love gaming but all I have is a crappy laptop and I can not afford a better one right now either.\\n\\nDue to all of this, it pains me when we leave class and almost every friend of mine hops into their car while I walk home or they give me a lift. Same when my friends talk about such and such video game while I sit there thinking what 2002 game I should play.\\n\\nNow, I know what you are (probably) going to say: Some people have it worse. And I agree. But here\\'s the kicker. A lot of people also have it a lot better. Some dudes my age drive million dollar cars and have the most expensive shit, and I can not help but hate this life for being so unfair and wondering why I was not born rich too. And nobody seems to ever think about how quite a lot of people have it so much better, instead focusing on the people that have it worse. And that whole \"Money does not buy happiness\" is just a tactic for rich people to keep us simpletons from rioting against their evil thiefy asses and settle for the leftovers.\\n\\nThis also brings me to another issue: I hate rich people with all my broke-ass heart. I have rich friends and they are nice, but it seems like most rich people are complete assholes. And it irks me how some dudes flex their wealth even though their parents are rich, not themselves. But still, their life is a lot easier and more fun. And I hate them because of my envy. This poisons my soul and makes me a bitter person.\\n\\nAgain, I would love to work and buy the stuff I want, but I really do not have time for a job. Med shool is quite hard, and not even the quarantine makes it any better since I still wake up early, still study, still partake in classes and lectures (online) and still have assignments. I do not know what job I could possibly sneak into my schedule since I have like 2 free hours daily. And this is not bullshit, I am down to try anything if you have suggestions.\\n\\nEvery day, from when I wake up until I go to sleep, I hate my life for being so mediocre and unfair. Please help me stop being so materialistic. I am sure there are lots of wise people here that could guide me and save my soul. This thing is ruining me, it is really bad. It clouds my judgement and makes me hateful. But no matter how hard I try, I always come back to my mindset of \"Why should I bother working my ass off just to MAYBE have a fraction of what other people lucked into at birth? Why play the rigged game? Life is unfair and I should not bother since I was unlucky at birth\"\\n\\nPlease help me get rid of this mentality. I know I am a hateful piece of shit that does not appreciate what he has, but I want to change this.Yesterday I took 12 shots of vodka.... and I do not drink. I always think it is going to help my depression and it always makes it worse. Not to mention I can never sleep even after it is worn off, like rn it is 4 am and here I am, typing this. My bf caught me cutting in the shower... and... do you ever just want the sun to come up? I will be able to make bacon & eggs then. it is all about little things like that I think.This is a bit of a rant so I am sorry in advance.\\n\\nSince January I have been at the lowest point(s) of my life. I felt so empty and lifeless that I placed an expiration date for myself, on March 15th if things in my life had not gotten better I would have killed myself by jumping off of a bridge a few towns over. Things got marginally better and I did not have the inclination to go through it on march 15th, but two weeks prior to that date I slipped mentally and tried to sufficate myself in my bathroom. I think I knew it would not work but I was hoping it would. To me that was **ROCK BOTTOM** and I have been doing so poorly since then. Between then and the date I orginally chose to kill myself, I picked up vaping nicotine to deal with the feeling of unworthiness. The date approaching was traumatic and so was already having attempted to kill myself. Shortly after, and having quit vaping, I was forced to move back home from college. At this point I feel like I am below rock bottom. I am beyond depressed. I can not feel happy which probably is depression BUT I can not feel sadness either, it is like I have been devoid of emotion which is extremely unsettling and concerning.I do not understand what is wrong with me \\nHow can i go from so happy one day to feeling absolutely miserable less than 24 hours later. Why do the things that made me happy no longer make me happy. Even things that I liked a few days ago. Why is my motivation gone. What happened to my happy thoughts, or even my semi positive thoughts. I had a lot of hope for the future and I can not find it anymore . Why do I feel so worthless now. Why do I feel like a failure now. Why has the progress I made suddenly vanished.Why do the things in our life happen? Why can not we control what happens to us, we are like dust in the wind... why do people die? Why are we here...For a while I thought I was handling my depression pretty well and that I was on the road to getting better, but this covid lockdown just destroyed all of that. I feel absolutely hopeless, panicked, and I do not feel like doing anything at all. I can not make myself do my school work or hardly get out of bed. I just do not find any motivation or reason to do anything anymore. I do not have any distractions like school or trips to the record store, online school is absolutely horrible and stressful due to the pressure and my trouble with understanding without hands on help, I feel more alone than I ever have, I can not do a single thing without my stepdad screaming at me for no reason. I can not even go on walks to get excercise because of the shitty neighborhood I live in but all the gyms are closed. All I am doing is rotting in front of a screen and eating like shit. I just want things to go back to normal so I can distract myself again. No one knows when this quarentine will be over and that is the worst part. I am not sure if I can take any more of this. I do not even know what my career future will be. I was going to go into the medical field but now I am rethinking it. I just do not really know why I am here or where I am going anymore. Everything just feels so redundant and pointless. it is the same thing every day. I try to be optimistic but I just can not see a light at the end of the tunnel.Has anyone ever bought a pet so they could have a companion that offers unconditional love and to essentially be their rock? What with quarantine restrictions and all I feel like now is as good of a rine as any to get a pet (while I am home full time for a few months) so I can spend the early part of their life with them every day. I absolutely love dogs but feel like that is a bit of a big responsibility to take on considering the training it needs and the fact that I live in an apartment. Any cat lovers out there feel like their cat is their bestfriend and saves them on their down days?Obviously a suicidal person does not want to hurt people in most cases. Its just that the weight of the nothingness outweighs the pain of others. Its always about someone else, and never about the person with the problem. \"Oh, you are suffering, but too bad, other people need your ass and it does not matter how you feel.\" I just do not see how people think piling on more guilt and responsibility to someone already struggling is a good idea.my family is not helpful. I am not happy just want to end myself but too afraid toI think after 20 years of this shit it is probably time to throw in the towel.  I am not talking suicide, I am giving up on looking for treatment.  I think in the time I have been trying to get help I have probably tried almost every med out there and the end result is that not only am i depressed but i now have a long list of permanent side effects that make my life even more miserable, something i had not thought was possible.  it is honestly rather amazing that nothing seems to help the pain.  Hell, i even tried drinking depression away only to find that the more drunk i got the more i hated myself.  \\n\\nIn all honesty, I would have taken a long walk off a short pier years ago if it were not for my family.  there is just something so uplifting about having 6-7 members of your family tell you (at different times) they do not want you to kill yourself because it would make them sad.  I am sure they thought they were helping in their own inept way but really, all it did was drive home the fact that my whole life I have been an utter failure and all I have ever really done is hurt and disappoint my family.  So as much as i would love to become intimate with a bridge abutment.  I am stuck here in my little hole, it is the one thing i can do that will not disappoint anyone or because me more pain.  I have no idea why the fuck I am posting this, maybe spreading the misery around will make it feel better.Misery. I experience it first hand. Second hand. Third hand. It surrounds me. My light has dimmed to nothing. it will never rekindle. Nothing on this god forsaken planet is worth being here. Voices screaming in my mind. Sleep. it is the only escape. Death is eternal sleep. does not sound bad. I can not focus. Where did my life go? Shit, I do not want it. I want to end it. And I do not care if it hurts.Hey! I wanted to share a story in the hopes of maybe helping some people. So I have major depressive disorder and have struggled with it all my life. I was having a pretty bad episode after not having one for years when I went to the doctor to get some blood work for an unrelated reason. It turns out that I was severely difficient in vitamin D. I was perscribed pills, and they have had the biggest impact on my depression that any medication has ever had. it is like night and day. I am currently going through a breakup that came out of nowhere and I am actually doing ok. If you live in an area with overcast weather or rarely leave the house and do not get sun, I would ask your doctor about it, or if you can not do that just try some over the counter stuff. it is not a miracle cure even if you do have a difficiency, but it could really help.I [22M] wish I was never born into this shitty existence of a life. Not one day has gone by where I can throughly say I am happy with my life. I am in debt, banking on a degree that might get me no where, making 9 dollars an hour, I have no life outside of work. All my friends are over the internet. No one makes plans with me, no one stops by to see me, no one cares. Even if they did my life still sucks. I am just genuinely at the point where everyday becomes more a struggle. I have to take medications to feel normal (have anxiety disorder/ PTSD) . I am constantly having mental breakdowns. I hate where I live but I have no way out. I can not afford to live somewhere on 9 bucks an hour. So I am stuck here. In hell. I hate my life everyday and the idea that it is going to get better somehow as if all my life\\'s problems will be gone just is not true. As time as went on in the past decade it is only gotten worse. My moms on the brink of death with her drinking addiction. My mental problems are through the roof. I feel so helpless. \\n\\n I have been getting mental help for almost a decade now and it just feels like my depression can never go away. I am so nervous that once I graduate college that job I want will not be there... I am going to college for my dream job. I have always wanted to be a journalist or something to do with writing, talking about sports whether it be a reporter, news station , just something with sports. The only things keeping me going is I know I am pursuing my dream and what I love to do. But I am so scared that once I do get my degree that job that I have always wanted will not be there and my degree in journalism and mass communications will be worthless :(. I do not want to be a failurebut now i realize how naive i was to think it was possible to be “above” depression, “above” suicidal thoughts. before this i was always in charge of my feelings, and i thought it was just how the brain worked. you recognize your emotions and you control them and you act on them. happiness, sadness, anger, fear; it is *your job* to control them, and if you can not, then you are failing. that is how i always thought.\\n\\nbut now i fucking swear my depression is totally in charge of me and i can not regain that control. it does not just make me cry and mope, it completely changed the way i think. i lost my level-headedness that i was always so proud of. my depression keeps me up until 5 am and wakes me up at 8. I am so tired that i have to drink tons of coffee but i can not eat a bite of anything without feeling immediately nauseated. so all that is in my system is caffeine, all day, every day. always jittery and anxious and in cold sweats. i feel like I am some form of walking depression.\\n\\ni never thought I would understand how some people could be moved to suicide. i know i have things and people to live for. i know i have people who love me and who’d be devastated if i really did it. i always felt a little anger for people who so readily expressed their desire to die because i know it costs so much for the loved ones of suicide victims. \\n\\nbut like i said, depression controls you. it makes me think differently about suicide. yes, i would devastate my loved ones by killing myself. but, as insensitive as this sounds, i would not feel the guilt of hurting them. I would be dead. besides, they would overcome it. they would mourn me, miss me, some longer than others, but it would not kill them. they would learn to be strong and they would finally take me seriously enough learn from my mistakes. i know i have a lot of life ahead of me right now. but do i? “it gets better.” says who? who is to say it does not get worse? every time I have been in a low place, it gets “better” just long enough that i let my guard down. then it gets bad again, seemingly worse each time. i reassure myself sometimes by picturing myself happy, with a family and tons of kids. that is my dream. but why should i believe that will happen? i can not make someone fall in love with me. not everyone finds love, and that is just a fact.\\n\\nit just seems it is very possible that I am suffering like hell right now because I am holding onto hope that it will get better, when i could just stop.I just keep crying. I have always been emotional but lately it is been getting bad. Whether it is music or visionary i cry at certain things... memories... all of the aboveI am going to graduate highschool in like a month. I already got into college but I do not know if I even want to go. College looks like fun but at the same time I do not know if I would even like it. And I will be damned if I am going to get a degree so I can work some dumbass 9-5 every day. I do not want to work at a pizza place the rest of my life either, which is the job I have now. I do not want to have a job at all so how the hell am I supposed to decide what to do with my life? I feel like I could do whatever I want but I do not want to do anything. \\n\\nI just want to sleep half the day and spend the other half watching tv with my dog or something for the rest of my life. But I live like that now and I do not like that either so what is the pointI am having a rough time. I am just so sad  and I do not know why. I just want to get better for my children and myself.Idk why maybe because people and the world suck and this is my way of showing anger. Sometimes I feel like just ending it so there is one less person for everyone to deal withI was on the verge of tears and my boyfriend asked me if I was sad because I sounded sad (were in a call, we fall asleep in a call every night.) and I said I was just tired because it is 1am, it is believable. In reality, I am really hurt. I am really really upset. I just do not think I have the right to be sad or upset because my life is not half as bad as others. My parents are together, they at least act like they care. we are decently well off so I have a lot of luxuries in life that I know others do not have. I have an amazing boyfriend. I get a lot of things that I want- to be quite honest I could have easily become spoiled the way I am growing up. \\n\\nI literally do not have the right to be upset. If my life is perfectly fine then I should be too. I feel so worthless - which I also do not believe I have the right to feel. I do not have the right to feel any emotion other than happy, yet here I am. I only try to show people me as a happy careless loving person. Yet here I am probably considered fake as fuck because in reality I am super sad all the time and just can not show it because I risk losing or hurting people. I am worthless. Ha. Ha. Ha.So I am going to keep this short and sweet. Been smoking weed and drinking alcohol for 2-3 years to cope with shit. Has it really helped? No. Will I/ can I stop? Also no. And this virus shit has not helped. School was the only thing keeping me productive and now the only time I get up is to get more drugs. I have now tried many other drugs, basically anything except coke, meth, and heroin. 2 days ago I was walking around my neighborhood, tripping on dxm and weed when I ran into a garbage can. I fell on the ground and did not get up for 30 minutes straight, wallowing in my own self pity. Just wish something else was worth doing.I have not felt like this in so long. I smoked tn when I probably should not have and now everything I have kept bottled up for months have just come back. I can not talk to anyone because I can not get myself to be comfortable to open up with anyone even my girlfriend who I do not deserve. This quarantine has made it all worse because this is my senior year of high school and surrounding myself with friends has always been a distraction whether it is at school or just hanging with my friends. Now I am alone all the time and all I have are these sad thoughts. I do not know what is going to happen when everyone goes to college and I am stuck in my hometown at community college. I am going to be so lonely. I just want to truly be happy without these sad thoughts in the back of my head all the timeMy life is terrible I have no friends no irl friends for months and my online friend cut contact with me not sure y I am completely alone the worst part is that I can not isolate in peace my mom and her boyfriend had a fight he started with me saying he was going to fight me for no reason lasted all day cops were called and because of the virus they can not kick him out he knows this and abuses it saying more things constantly trying to get me out I went to my dads for the week too more fighting it is driving me insane I can not even feel safe In either house virus shut down my job nor money to move out I have no one and it is hard I do not want to get up to hear more fighting or I am woken up to it I am losing myself and my thoughts have gotten darker each day I thought I wanted no school but it is the only thing that got me away from home now I am stuck and I can not deal with it anymore I am the fight my step dad destroyed my pc I o my have my phone and no other way to take my mind off things there only so much you can do on your phone honestly I do not think I am going to make it out of quarantineSo I live away from my parents and I did not get to say goodbye to my dog. I was hoping to see her this summer.\\n\\nRight now I feel like a she will of a person. I do not feel human. I feel numb. I feel empty. I feel like I will never be happy again, and that nothing will ever make me happy. I feel like nothing that used to make me happy or content, like friends, food, books, movies, video games, etc, whatever it is, could ever make me feel whole again. I used to love baking and cooking and eating, but now I have no interest. And I can not be with friends now because of Covid. I live alone. \\n\\nI have talked to my family over the phone about our loss, but that will not bring her back. Me eating a lovely piece of chocolate will not bring her back. \\n\\nI want her back. I want her young and healthy again. I want to tell her that I love her. I want to see her running around joyfully. that is the only thing I want. Knowing that I will never get her back makes me feel devoid of everything except loss.\\n\\nIt hurts. I feel it in my soul. A piece of me is gone forever.I am breaking apart and I am constantly on the verge of either screaming in anguish or crying and I have no control over my life right now. Usually that excuse is bullshit but I have lost any control over my life with this pandemic and it is hurting me. My college shut down and I do not have the resources to do it online at home but they do not give a fuck so I will just fail, my job has cut my hours and I can not see the few friends I do have because no one is allowed out. My life is shit and it is putting me in a hole and now I can not do anything about it. I do not know what to do and I am so tired of waiting for the day when it will be better and I can do fucking do something that will make a difference.Is what I do everyday at work when my coworkers ask me how I am. What I really want to say is that I have been seriously depressed for the last few weeks if not months. I do not remember.\\n\\nI thought I was getting better. I have lost over 150 pounds. I look good. I get hit on and flirted with a lot. I have someone falling for me, I am falling for her. Yet, I do not feel good. \\n\\nI am not happy, but I should be. Everything in my life is going great. College, work, my relationships. But, I feel so insecure about life. I am afraid of losing it all and just having it come crashing down on me. \\n\\nI do not want these feelings anymore. Why am I experiencing these feelings so strongly. it is as if life\\'s ocean is crashing into my soul and I can not seem to escape the current. \\n\\nI am drowning. But I do not want to reach out, I do not want to push all of the people in my life away from me. I am scared of losing them, of losing her, and she is not even mine. \\n\\nSo I will just keep saying \"I am good\" and I will smile. And I will keep making them laugh, making her laugh and smile and bring happiness into all of my family and friends life, because they deserve it.\\n\\nI am okay with drowning in my thoughts, and thinking that one day I will be happy, waking up next to the love of my life. But I know deep inside that I will never be good enough for anyone.I do not like being alone with my own thoughts, prior to this pandemic, I spent the minimal amount of time home alone as possible. I study in the library or in coffee shops and I eat in cafeterias etc. I also maintain a lot of friendships. Unlike a lot of people, I do not really get much out of entertainment media — I am not a fan of most TV shows, movies or video games. I can not be satisfied to sit at home and watch Netflix or read books all day. \\n\\nAll that is to say that this quarantine is extremely hard for me. I can not focus on anything and I feel quite depressed. I spend much of my days sleeping in order to avoid being alone with my own thoughts.  I am sad.Everything I attempt to do, I am garbage at. Social interaction, trying to play video games, being a productive human, mattering to people, being attractive. Literally anything I try to do for enjoyment I end up being garbage at. I am just sick of everything and want this all to endUsually I feel really lonely during my day,but lately I have not felt like that,in fact I do not really miss having someone with me because I already forgot how it felt like to have a friend with me or something like that,all I do is stay in my room all day and feel little to nothing all the time,I do not want to suicide that badly anymore,but still it did not solve the problem that I can not really live in the reality I am part right now,I am only ignoring the problemI have African parents and i always am pushed to do my best, and i do but if it does not work out then i take the fall for something everybody does. do not get me wrong i love my parents without them i can not even stand to look at myself because i know if i was worthless i would not be put through multiple rounds of being pressured. I play soccer, I am the best on my team and i carry them to the state cup final every year. But if i lose in a team sport with ten other kids i rely on I am in trouble. \\n\\nI try my best but if your really struggling(I am not hopefully you are not ) you need to speak to a hotline a family member or somebody else.\\n\\nIn all truth i think suicides wrong life can always change, we have one life in infinity, do not throw it away on this. No matter how scared you are of the reactions it is better than just leaving forever. I know that is not what you wanted when you were first born. \\n\\nSo please whatever’s getting you down can always change. I know that when i get depressed all i do is think about what i want to be i break it down into a plan and have multiple backup strategies in the event of failure. If you make it somewhere i applaud you but if not remember that not everything was done at the first try.\\n\\nI thank you guys for even reading this I am signing off for now i hope i can change some lives for the betterLivng alone sucks so bad. \\n\\nI wish I had a healthy family that i could stay with as long as i could.\\n\\nI moved out when I was 17. And ever since I got my own place it is been nothing but working full time and stress. I feel I have no one and can not shake the feeling of being pushed aside by everyone. I have isolated myself to the point where my only real friend is my ex that left me. I am such a bother to everyone. I do not want to start school bc then I would have to cut my work hours which would stress me out even more, but I am already 21 and can not put it off anymore. I just want to leave, I will never be anything anyway, there is nothing here for me.\\n\\nI had not cut in years but recently I have relapsed so deep to the point I had to get stutures for them, idk what to do\\n\\nTl;dr just a late night rant.I will never be anyone, I will never matter, I will never BE. Things just \"are not\" anymore. I have been thinking about self harm and suicide but, I do not want to hurt my mom. Nothing makes me want to try anymore, before quarantine I used to be so passionate about academics, but online school is murdering me and it takes nearly everything out of me to get it done. I, just want to give up, I only have 2 people who truly care about me, my mom and my best friend Xander, he is the only one who knows I am depressed and he helps me through things. I am also just angry at the world and I am filled with so much hate towards society and people. I do not understand why some nothing like me gets to be a nothing while everyone else is happy, it is not fair. The only things I enjoy anymore are watching Swagkage and SethTheProgrammer (they are Narutubers), play Rivals of Aether with Xander, and play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I just bought the DLC for it and I have been enjoying the new outfits the DLC comes with. Well anyway in the comments do not say \"feel better\" because I know you little retards are just saying it because you feel it will make you morally better, it will not. It does not help. Also if you read all the way I do not see why you did. I am nothing, I do not matter and I can not see why you even bothered to take time out of your pitiful existence to listen to this.It seems I am nothing and I feel nothing and I try to feel I try but I give upHave you ever thought about how there are hundreds of thousands of people that will go their entire lives without a suicidal thought, and hen there is us?I have come to the realization that I am depressed and need therapy/maybe medication. I am open to trying anything. But I am not sure how to go about trying to find a therapist during this. I looked through my insurance and I have a few therapists I could go to but they are not offering in person or online therapy. Are there websites or something I could do telehealth therapy on?\\n\\nI am out of college so that is not an option but I do have insurance.I have been abused on and off throughout my life, so gaslighting is nothing new to me. I am so full of hatred towards myself that when I start talking bad about myself in my head, it is just another person. I call her the bitch in my head because duh. \\n\\nI have been trying hard for years to think more positively, like instead of saying \"I want to die\" I will try to say \"I do not want to die, I just want to stop hurting.\" But when the bitch starts saying horrrible things, like \"you are such a terrible person\" I can not say \"no, I am not a bad person\" because that is exactly what I would say if I was a bad person. A  bad person would deliberately play up their suffering to make themselves look like an innocent victim so they could do no wrong. What if that is what I am doing but I am so good that I even fooled myself to I think I deserve saving? What if I have subconsciously tricked myself into thinking I am innocent? I can not tell. I do not think I could ever be able to tell.\\n\\n For all I know, the bitch in my head is right about everything and I ought to just kill myself to save everyone else from me. But then again thinking I matter enough at all for people to be afraid of me is so arrogant. Who do I think I am? Why would anyone notice me, good or bad? I am just starting to spiral now into this infinite loop of hate. I really, really do not want to die, but for the love of anything remotely holy, I can not keep living like this.\\n\\nTLDR: existence is agonyEverything I do is dumb. I am delusional.\\n\\nI am making no effort to get better.\\n\\nI want to save something incapable of being saved.\\n\\nI am less.\\n\\nI am nothing.\\n\\nPain lives in the comparisons.\\n\\nThe perceived shortfalls, possessions, feelings, importance.\\n\\nSo deserving.\\n\\nNever listening. Only telling.\\n\\nStrong, and never wrong. Never. I was wrong then, but not now.\\n\\nit is the body that is weak.\\n\\nEnsnaring Life forever. Mine.\\n\\nPamper my existence.

Sorry I am getting off track, but basically I feel fine I e Minute then my mom does something stupid like that, and I just loose it, I loose control of my emotions bc the shit she does to me stresses me out to a point where I have no control over my emotions, I wish I could leave, if anything she is going to be the person who makes me end everything, she does not know how to help, she overreacts and is just a bitch most of the time. I wish there was somewhere I could but there is not. it is not like I can leave bc I am only (male15) but still I want to leave, who know when I would leave forever, but there is a chance it is gets to that point, I am so tired of the life I life. I only have a few things that actually make me happy. I really do not understand why my mom does shit like that, it does not help me, it destroys my mental stability, I can not control myself, and my emotions. Yet I still hide all my emotions from her, bc if I tell her how I feel she will not help, she will not know how, she will make things worse. I am so tired of being In this house, I want out, I want to go, I am want to give up, I have very little left, I can barely see the light at the end of my tunnel. I am so broken, everyone I talk to says the bad things are temporary, yet I can not see them letting go anytime soon if ever.all this shit is tearing me apart, I do not know how to feel anymore, I do t know what to do. I am want to give up, but I know I would hurt my friends and my family if I did that, but it is still an idea......Want to die per usual. Anyone want to help me? I would like to vent to someone. I would prefer someone whose understanding/ a good listener. Thanks.Some days I feel like I am doing okay and maybe I can deal with this. But some days... fuck me. On top of clinical depression, I have severe anxiety and PTSD.. My family lost our house in January and I moved from FL to AZ to be with my boyfriend and not homeless. But no matter what I do I am never good enough for my family. I have not \"sacrificed\" anything in their lives. They constantly remind me of my shortcomings and pick on me and he just begs me to ride it out until we can move our new trailer off their land so I do not have to deal with it anymore. Some days I feel like I can do it. But today.... fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This was a bad day.\\n\\nI got randomly grabbed out of nowhere on the neck, picked on a little in a fun joking manner but my anxiety took it and ran, and I realized nobody needs me anymore. Nobody. At my home I had 12 pets. 4 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos. I lost 2 of the dogs and 3 of the cats. My leopard geckos are being housed with a friend but they can not take care of them much longer. My remaining dogs and cats, including my service dog, are with a foster mom. Since Coronavirus I lost my job and their trip (that I am paying for) to me is postponed indefinitely. they have all accepted her as their mom.\\n\\nMy pitbull hated her new collar that I sent her at first because that was the collar she knew with me. But she also had it during 2 trips to the pound (when I adopted her she had it and when my mom dropped her at the pound she kept it before I had a friend readopt her for me as I was already across the country. I paid for it.) Today foster mom tells me she loves the new collar now. The old collar got brought out and she ran from it. She ran. She does not need me anymore. None of them do. My service dog accepted foster mom as new home within a week. Pitbull took 2 months but she is finally given up on me. My cats never needed me. I was a fool to think they did. I have never been without pets ever. I am 19, we always had at least 3 in my household. they are my reason for living. I am becoming a veterinarian to help them. I have wanted to since I was 9. But they do not need me. I am useless. And worthless. I can not commit suicide because my instinct to survive is too strong. it is like my brain and heart want to die but my body will not give up on me. I can not bring myself to try. I can not even do that right...\\n\\nSorry for the rant. I needed to get some stuff out there to people who will understand.I am a teen and my life sucks I am homeschooled because I was bullied for being short and have been mistreated for years and even by my friends since pre school. And I am worried about the corona virus for other reasons and now I heard that my brother got her girlfriend pregnant and they are 16 and 17 and I do not know what to do I am freaking out I worry everyday and I am crying and this is stupid but I always say “it I do not ____ I die” like if I do not go to the bed in 5 seconds I will die like I am pretty sure it is with my ocd or something but it pressures me someone please helpI am 18, class of 2020. Ya perfect time for all of this to hit, really. Truth is, I was doing so well, like a lot of people here. I had finally clawed my way out to a “stable” mindset and really thought for once it was going to be ok for a little while. Coronavirus hysteria has held me hostage for a month now. I can not see my boyfriend, and quite frankly it is taken a toll on him, too. With both of us sinking into depressive episodes and being locked away, it is hard to connect consistently anymore. I had no friends to begin with. I lost my job and now have a solid $26 to survive the next unknown amount of time with. My bed has a dent I have been laying in it so long.\\n\\nMy point is, just like everyone, I am losing my shit in this quarantine. Every anxious, OCD, depressing thought is here to play. No amount of working out, arts and crafts, movies, or taking a walk will stop them anymore.\\n\\nI am sick of people saying it gets better. it is not getting better, and I am sick of lying to myself that it will be. My youth is being eaten up by some asshole who ate a bat. The perfect time for a depressed graduate to try to start up life is in a economic crisis, right?\\n\\nFuck the guy who ate the bat, fuck the people who can not stay inside because “muh kids need 4 gallons of milk and 80 packs of toilet paper”, and fuck all of this. I am tired.I spend my days playing games and cutting. I can not fucking take this life anymore. The world\\'s fucked this whole thing is so fucked. I hate this life, no one likes me I can not sleep nothing works I am just completely and utterly fucked. And I am too scared to end it. Like, how fucking hard is it I can do it rn. FuckI am not going without my phone. My brain is on this thing. My books my music, everything. what is everyone’s experience with this?So I just discovered \"Runaway by Lil Peep.\"\\n\\nCan you guys give me your favorite songs to listen to with similar vibes, or just good songs when you depressed in general. I want to make a playlist.\\n\\nThank you.I have talked to therapists. I am on meds. I am doing the best I can but I am stuck. I am drinking a lot these days (after being sober for months) because it gives me a few hours of disconnection to the numbness. I know that does not help anything but I also want some immediate relief and it is all I have. I know this pandemic is the reason my depression has escalated to an uncontrollable level but I can not fill the emptiness. My bf said today “it is like you are not fighting”. I am fighting. But it is like expecting someone who just got their arm cut off to pick up a sword. Someone please, tell me how to keep going. I am tired all of the time. I am not suicidal per se, but I am not alive. I have not been for weeks now.Some thoughts I had:\\n\\n \"Why do we cut? Is it because we are depressed? It it because we try to show people that their words do not hurt as much as the blade? Or do we just want to feel something? Whatever the reason is; we (not all) feel the need to be asked.\\n  We do not like it when you found out that from someone else. We want to tell you what goes through our mysterious minds. Is a bit difficult when you are yelling though.. you are not the \"police\" trying to make us tell you some type of information. If you could just CALMY ask us. Screaming will just make us want to keep all our feelings out of your sight so that you will not yell.\\n  We understand that you are worried or desperate to know,but we will not tell you willingly if you do not want to listen willingly. Please try understand.. we feel like no one could ever care if we die,disappear,or have problems in our lifes. You probably never went through what we went through. We can feel that you are upset or disappointed at us, but please.. do not give up on us.\\n  We might keep doing it until we are as empty as an egg she will. Not only do we cut,but we try to get rid of pain in many ways. Some do drugs,vape,drink,or are just darn mean. Some cut,bite,try to suffocate, drown,hang,or cry. We are people; and just like animals:not all of us are bad.\\n  When I get upset at someone,I do many different things. I get out of there,I break something,bite, or just cry for how much I feel like hurting them. While am typing this.. I cutted my arm.. a little too dip than usual. My arm feels tingly, numb,and I feel an urge to taste my blood. Wierd?\\n  When people make me feel depressed, I have a sick pain in my stomach that makes me feel like throwing up or punching my stomach. I just read that when you cut yourself; your life spam(or something like that) decreases by 6%. I must be close to dying then :\\')... I have many friends that do the same,that feel like they can not keep on going. Some friends that I left behind because of moving. \\n  She had depression.. I do not know how she is doing now. I hope she made it to the top! After talking to one of my old friends, she said that four people had died during Freshman year. I was so worried that it could have been my friend.. I left her without succeeding to make her change her mind.\\n  I have more in my mind,but am too tired. I will go to sleep now. Night. And morning just in case I do not wake up..\"I think like many people on here, I have been plagued by depression most of my life. At least as far back as I can remember, likely the early teenage years (I am 25 now). With being indoors all day, it only has gotten worse. \\n\\nMy depression has never made me think about suicide, not even for a fraction of a second. I just never have thought about it.\\n\\nMy depression is simply lack of literally all energy. I wake up, and lay in bed for a solid 3 hours (on a good day). I think nothing happy, and just feel absolutely no happiness or urgency to do anything. \\n\\nOver the past year, since being in grad school, my depression has most definitely gotten worse. I do not want to get up. No amount of caffeine can help me accomplish anything. I truly just do NOT have energy in me.\\n\\nI have tried everything to bring positive change in my life. After the 3 hours of doing Fuck all, I drag myself to the gym 5-6 days a week. I am able to eat healthy. I have managed to get quite muscular, while at the same time being horribly depressed with no desire to pursue friendships or relationships. I go on long walks, I run and other forms of cardio.\\n\\nThere is only so much exercise and self care I can do. It keeps me from falling into a true pit of despair I believe, but it certainly does not cure my depression in the slightest.\\n\\nI have now started to think trying anti depressants may be for me. I had my testosterone tested. Twice. it is completely normal. So I know it is not lack of that hormone, which I had suspected before to due lack of libido.\\n\\nDoes this sound like a case which would see a positive change by trying anti depressants? Can I at least try it, come off if I do not like it? I honestly do not know what else to do at this point. I am not in danger of trying to take my own life. I just simply do not have energy to DO any life.So I have been on anti-depressants for about 5 years. 2 years ago I found a medication that works really well for me. Last year I was consistently feeling good so my psychiatrist started tapering me down. The past couple months however I started having days where I just get really down. At first I thought it could just be the normal ups and downs a person has, but those days have been becoming more frequent and now most days of the week I am left feeling that once familiar emptiness of depression. I am scared to bring it up to my parents, since they were happy about me getting off the meds.There was this time I decided to tell everyone in my family that I was bi. Everyone was cool about it, and it made me happy:)... except for the person I live with.. my grandma. She was the last person to know. she is a Christian person that does not approve of this type of thing and says people are just being rebellious and are going to Hell for that. \\n  We were outside, sitting around a small table in our front of the house. Just enjoying the day with some coffee and tea(me lol). I already had made up my mind to tell her about it. I was shaking. I wrote down what I felt that day(July 4, 2019). This is what I wrote:\\n \\n\" I told my grandma that I liked girls. And now I can not stop crying for what she told me.. I have a major headache for holding back my screams.. or probably because I started hitting my head on the floor.\\nI feel like leaving because there is just no way of undoing this. Why did I say that? I was having a lovely morning and I opened my big stupid mouth! I do not feel like getting out of my room for anything.. I have not had breakfast either.. shit. \\nI just have got to calm down.. but I can not! When I think I finally stopped crying, I think of what happened and more tears keep reappearing.. kill me please.\"\\n  \\n  I told her that she would be disappointed and would throw me out. She was disappointed and said that she would not throw me out. She was just a bit upset that she would not be able to keep the promise she kept to my mom(Rest in Peace) of making sure I was a good Christian kid to be able to get into Heaven and see her again. I was crying in front of her. She did not yell, but I could hear the disappointment in her voice. \\n These days we get along. Probably forgot all about it or just thought it was a phase. I will not bring it up around her though. I choose peace while I still live with her. I do not like loudness. Not negative loudness that is.there is a saying I like to say and it means a lot to me .  It says a lot to people that have issues of every day life and how it effects them \\nI have depression and anxiety may be not the same as everyone else has .. but this is all the same concept. Please take it as it is and smile because someone out there is thinking of you.\\n\\nDepression is like a long big heavy coat  someday we will be able to walk over to the wall hang it on a hook and walk away.(30M) While I do believe that Instagram can be a good platform to promote certain things like photography, music, etc., on the flip side, I do feel like it is just not good for you if you suffer with depression and/or anxiety. People constantly show off how nice looking their bodies are, brag about how successful they are, etc., and it just fuels my depression like crazy. I try the best I can not to spend a lot of time on there for the sake of my mental health.This stupid virus has done too much damage already. I want it to be over.\\n\\nI went from paranoid delusions, fearing the end of the world, to this fucking depression. I feel nothing but isolation. Contact with my friends no longer helps, because we are not face to face. I find that I draw my happiness from contact with others. Being without my friends has sucked the life out of me. My soul hurts. I spend more of my day sleeping and moping around instead of doing things I enjoy. When I try to do things I enjoy, I cannot stay focused. Instead, I keep focusing on how alone I am.\\n\\nI spent the better part of the evening staring at my razor blade and thinking about what my death would feel like. What would it feel like to watch my life bleed out of me? Would it hurt? Would it be fast? Would my friends miss me? Would they even get to have a funeral? How would my wife feel? How would my family be impacted?\\n\\nWhy do I feel like this? Why can not I just be normal? I want to stop hurting.I deserve to feel the pain and the tears because I have caused people just as much pain and tears.Everyone I know is either getting married or has a deep family connection or fucking something. I have never been able to get close to my family, and in all honestly I truly believe their lives would be exactly the same if not better if I was not here. All I can do every day of every week of every goddamn month is just lay in my bed and do nothing. I do not have the energy to get out, to better myself, to do fucking ANYTHING. Sure I have some friends, but they do not see me more than once every two weeks, but anyone that I have spent longer periods of time with could not fucking stand me for longer than a week. And do not even get me started on relationships, where the idea of being with me is so horrible that every girl has left within a week, and that is not even an exaggeration, I have had more relationships last 2 days than last a full month. If my family does not care that I am here, if my friends rarely ever see me and therefore rarely ever think of me, and love is something that I can never have, then why in the fuck am I even fucking here in the first place. I just want this all to end, I am so fucking tired. I just wish someone would come kill me so I would not have to do it myself, I can not fucking do this anymorewell this hurts me a lot. I have recently been told\\n\\n\"if you are not christian, you deserve all hatred in the world.\"\\n\\nwow. just wow. please do not come attacking me because I do not believe in your religion. if you actually appreciated your religion, you would not be mean to people you do not even know. :\\') \\n\\ni know we say stuff like this all the time, but this just really hurts man. when people just say \"if you do not believe in this you are stupid and deserve this and that\" \\n\\njust shut up. \\n\\nthanks for reading this\\n\\nno hate please xxI can not get over my ex and I do not think I will ever love again so really what is the point of living. I do not know what to do anymore.My boss is very kind and personal. she is always notices when I am not as lifted as usual and checks in with me. It makes me think she somehow knows what I deal with.\\n\\nshe is the only person I feel comfortable reaching out to right now but I do not know if it is appropriate or if there is a point. I can not imagine there is anything she can actually do for me. I do not even know what I am hoping for. I really want help but I do not want it to just be a venting session where I am putting my pain onto her. \\n\\nWould appreciate any feedback on experiences with confiding in your boss and how I should go about it (if I should). Thanks. \\n\\nAlso, I am trying to seek medical support (therapist, medication, etc), but not many doctors are taking patients due to the pandemic.I get worried and paranoid sometimes, since I am easily trusting of certain things or just easily scared. Last year(September 15,2019) there were so many memes I saw in the internet (yes, I know is dumb. I get informed of everything through there-_-) about this one asteroid that was said to hit the Earth and destroy humanity. I was so paranoid and was never calm because of that. I would cry all the time, thinking how I wasted my years being introverted and never doing anything that would leave my mark in the world. It was said to kill us all in October 3rd. Everytime a day passed, I would cry and just regret my life choices, thinking I did not have time for anything. I was worried of dying from something else that was not myself. I did not like the idea of something or someone else hurting me, since I already did that. When the said day came, nothing happend. So I took that chance to actually get moving in making my mark. I became more confident because I did not want to waste any time mopping around.A couple of months ago, I (F19) tried to kill myself. I took around 20 aspirin and sort of kept to myself the whole day. I did not tell anyone and was hoping maybe I could drift away in my sleep. Although I had painful chest pains for the next couple of days, I did not die obviously. But I kind of knew it would not work. These aspirins were low strength and only 20 would not do it. I knew that I think. I do not understand why I did it. I did not tell anyone because I feel that it would disingenuous and make them feel bad for no reason.\\n\\nI do not know if something is wrong with me. From all of this, it sounds like there definitely is. But I am relatively normal aside from my depressive episodes. I like getting dressed up, have hobbies, care about things and people. I do find myself drifting away from life a bit, but at the end of the day, I still do normal things and behave normally. I have thought about killing myself numerous times and this time was the closest I ever got.\\n\\nI wrote a suicide note if that is important. I did not say bye to any of my friends over text or on the phone. In fact, I refrained from talking to them.\\n\\nI do not want to treat this as therapy lol. I just do not know if I am rational and sane right now honestly. I feel that my actions might have come from a desire to manipulate my friends and family.I live in a small apartment near my campus since the first time I enrolled in. I usually went home by train every 2 weeks to meet with my parents and asking me about my college progress. But it was then, when I seems to be enjoy my college life at the first semesters. At that time, my grades were relatively good, in my 6 courses each semester I got 2 A\\'s, 3 B\\'s and a D in calculus (I am sucks at math, and my math lecturer sucks too.\\n\\nThe second semester my grades were still good, with one D again in math. The third semester again was still good with no D\\'s.\\n\\nThen the fourth semester is the beginning of my end. My depression starts here and I slowly lose interest in going to college, there is one lecturer that is hated by all students in my major, he gives us quizzes and homeworks every single week and I got an E in that particular subject. I mostly got many C\\'s from now on and rarely B. \\n\\nThen came the 7th semester when things get worse than ever. My friends slowly moving away from me, they left me behind when doing group projects, they no longer responding me in group chats. I feel like I am a horrible and shameful mess.\\n\\nNow I am in the 8th semester, and the next May will be my 9th. But with all my shitty grades with many C\\'s and D\\'s, and some E\\'s I doubt that I will get thru it. I can not even think clearly, my mind is full of dark clouds with heavy thunderstorms raining shit. Then the corona came, and now I live in my parent\\'s apartment with my sister. I even forgot to pay my tuition fee and will likely to be extra charged. I do not even join my online classes.\\n\\nMy parents ask me the same things, the college, plus the internship program and thesis that will happen in 9th and 10th semester respectively. I do not know how to answer them questions like at what place you will take internship at? or how is the thesis? My grades are shit, and I will likely to retake my bad grades till next year. But how do I tell them? They keep pushing me and tell me about it. Now I got the email from my parents that my internship and thesis are swapped so my thesis should be in 9th semester. And I do not know what things to write that shit because I skipped classes.\\n\\nI began suicidal at the end of my 4th semester. Until now, I do not tell to my parents yet because I know it will hurt them feelings. I am starting to overdose my sleeping pills with hope that I will sleep forever before I am turning 21 at the end of this month. I can not jump off my room in 25th floor.he is only 45. But been a heavy drinker since he was younger than me. I am a 19 male in university. Few years ago his doctor said he had to quit drinking completely, his liver had a lot of scar tissue. Since then he is had phases where he lightened to beer, quit for maybe a month, but overall he has not really quit. Recently he is been drinking a lot because, he is a small business owner in Canada. Small businesses here have some infamy with tax evasion and the current government has decided to finally cut down on it. He was caught and has had troubles/problems since he got a big bill in the mail from the Canadian revenue agency. Which has had him drinking a lot more heavily the last 5 months.\\n\\nWell, his feet are extremely swollen. Google says a common because of this is liver Cirrhosis and the fluid just reaches the feet from gravity (he stands pretty much all day). Many people in my family has died of this. Everyone in his family has alcohol problems.\\n\\nLiver cirrhosis is the 3rd most common because of death for ages 45-65. He did it to himself.\\n\\nI do not really have anyone to talk to. I have been an asshole and a bully all my life. it is my fault I know. I just yeah i do not know so I guess posting on a subreddit is something to do.Do any of you guys sleep and wake up in the middle of the night once or twice panicking or just randomly?Or even wakes themselves up stressed, it is like the you kind of can not breathe so your taking multiple deep breathes..I am just looking to talk about life. Reflect ideas with other people who have the same depression issues. Do you ever feel like your life stopped and now you are just watching the world go by in a fading gray blur with no idea how to get better? I think about this constantly and it really makes me want to just go to sleep forever.I am not sure the best way to word this, but the biggest thing that is stopping me from trying to fix my mental health is the fear of what it would be like to not have a mental disorder. Someone put it this way once and it really resonates with me, \\n\\n\"You know what the sick thing is, I do not even want to get better, because I am scared of that too. This is  all I know. I do not remember being happy, I do not remember peace with myself\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHow do I try to fix this mindset because it is honestly tearing me apart and has been for a while and I really need to fix my mind if I am going to do anything with my lifeMy parents were in and out of my life and for the most part I was raised by my grandparents. My grandparents would pick me up from school during my very early elementary school years up to high school. I was always at their house early in life and when I got to high school they would come over everyday. In high school was when I never saw or spoke to my parents. When I was in high school and when my dad was able to drop me off at school, we never spoke to each other. Nothing was said from the time that I woke up to getting into his car to leaving. The most that he would say was “I will be in the car!” He was always on and off unemployment which sucked because my mom was in school and working a full time job. My dad would just complain that they were spending too much money on my education and kept asking me if I wanted to go to the local public school, not understanding the value of a private school education.  Though they all took turns parenting me, I was always distant with all of these family members. I remember coming home everyday, depressed just lying on the couch putting on the news everyday, just in my own little world. My grandma would come over to just do the dishes and leave. My mom was not going to do the dishes after working day and night everyday and my dad did not want to do them. Whenever I tried talking to my mom she would ignore me, always stressed from having the workload and responsibility that she had. When she is stressed she shuts down. After awhile I gave up on my relationship with my mom. If she does not want to talk to me she dosent have to to. But that is the last person in people’s lives that they would expect to not regularly engage with them. I felt so alone, abandoned. I was late to school everyday, ate the same food and sat at a lunch table that I knew would not judge me. I would not always talk. \\n\\nI just do not understand why my parents were not always there for me. They have since apologized but it is too late. They want me off of my meds but I just want to scream at them and tell them that you did this! I do not want to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It was your genes that I inherited and there were certain events that happened where you could have been there for me but since I had no one, I blamed myself for everything.  I had no one to combat those suicidal thoughts.  Where were my parents when I needed them? This could have been addressed so long ago but it is now that you are concerned about my mental health? I am depressed now and they have no idea. They were the most controlling parents growing up and I feel like my freedom would be threatened if I talked to them. Saying that it is in the past dosent change anything. I feel too proud to ask them for any help. I hired my psychiatrist and therapist for that. I would not want them to help me. I would never see my room again. They would be trying to talk to me the entire day but I am a very reserved person. Just seeing my dad triggers me. I am terrified about the thought that I might wake up someday and realize that I have not done a single fulfilling thing in my entire life. I just graduated so when the confinement is over I will be able to join the workforce but I am not at all passionate about my line of work, I chose it because it was the one I thought I would hate the least. I am not really good at anything, I have never really achieved anything noteworthy, if you asked me to tell you about the proudest moment of my life I would probably scratch my head for 5 minutes only to realize I really have not done anything ever. For some reason I recognize that but I do not do anything to change it, it is like I am waiting to magically feel happy and fulfilled for no apparent reason. I have ironically had a “I am going to CHANGE” sign taped on my wall for the past 3 years but nothing has realistically really changed at all. I am a useless human being and I will keep being one until the day I die, this is just the kind of person I am. Unable to do anything at all. All I know how to do is write late night rants that I am too afraid to share to anyone because I do not want people to realize how much of a fucking waste of space I am.(16m) I do not know how to go about asking for help. My parents have mental health issues that they take medication for, so I know they will understand. I really can not explain what is keeping me from talking to them about it. I think it mostly has to do with me hating pity. It makes me feel extremely guilty and like I am making someone waste their time worrying about me. I have been dealing with this for about 2 years and there is times where it gets so bad that I can not get out of bed and I obsessively think about suicide. I know I need help and I want help but I do not know how to get past the fact that I will hate myself for making them worry, because when I get pitied my mind decides I no longer want help and only want to die so I will not be able to bother anyone anymore. Thanks for reading this.My mental health is deteriorating more and more every day, and all i want to do isdrown myself in alcahol and sleep. My life is not going to improve soon, in fact, i think that it will never improve. I am a disappoitment to my parents, I am a disappoitment to my friends and even to myself. Every good thing that happened in my life I have found a way to destroy it. I am only 17 but I will probably be dead before i hit 25. I Just can not live with myself, i have a relatively good life and that is only makes me hate myself even more because i have no real reason to be like this. I do not want to think anymore, and the only way to stop my head is to pass out or kill myself. Sorry if i misspelled something, english is not my native language and I am not soberI just go to sleep hoping I do not wake up in the morning every night. I have no friends, no one cares about me or what I want, I am one if the unluckiest people in the world, my family DOES NOT care about me even though some people may say differently well they do not they never have and never will. Fuck it if no one cares about me then why should I.never good with words, but depressions just completely killed me. My friend killed herself way back in August and even now, it still hurts thinking about it, even reading old messages just makes me feel awful, people around me tell me to get better and forget but it just feels like it never happens. It just never feels like it gets any better, even today I still miss them so much even when it feels like I should not.Recently I have just cried for no reason multiple times throughout the day and some days I just slump on my bed, staring at the ceiling and cry. Like no one has died or anything I do not feel any pain or emotion at all but I just cry and wonder why I am crying in the first place. there is only that weight on my chest and tears because puddles around me. Is this what normal people do? Do people cry for no reason or is crying reserved for sadness?what is the point of trying to \"get better\" if your past has already robbed you of your future? Everything you could/should have been, now a fleeting dream as you wasted your years wallowing in misery. Do you even try to salvage that shit heap? Just for a lame, mediocre outcome that you know you will never be proud of?\\n\\nTried getting a normal person to understand that and you know their response? \"Kill yourself.\" (And they were quite adamant about it.) Funny how they think. But I guess if you do not fit in with the crowd or share their worldview, you will be cut off like a malignant tumor. Nature\\'s way, I suppose. At least I can feel accomplished that I got someone to see things my way for a change, even if they were not exactly willing to accept it. And it is not that I nor anyone else with depression *wants*  to feel or think the way we do. it is just how it is, as fucked up as it is...I have been struggling with depression for 2 years now is there anyone I could talk or have any ideas on how to overcome?I have done bad things in the past and I have tried to make up for them and the people I have affected say they forgive me but I know I am a bad person.\\nMy friends all disagree with me but my parents do not.\\nI try to be as nice and accepting to everyone as much as I can but I am annoying and people have told me I give off a toxic energy.\\nHow do I become a good person?I think he is suffering from depression. Below are examples of the messages he is sent me and he is completely shutting me out and refuses to talk. it is been around 10 days of this. \\n\\nI do not really know how to deal with the situation. Should I just let him be? Or should I keep insisting (E.g calling, going to his house, sending him texts)?\\n\\n“ Sorry I just do not have any energy. I want to be left alone for a while”\\n“ I love you too. Just need some time to myself. I am not feeling great and stressed and have no energy.”\\n“ I am stressed, I am tired, I am foggy. Just leave me be for a while”\\n\\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated,\\n\\nThanks!While I consider myself very fortunate that I have a friend I can be 100% myself with, it is killing me that I can not see him. I also feel like he deserves a better friend than me, so I am hesitant to reach out when I really him. I have been staying with my family -- whom are very loving -- throughout this COVID-19 bullshit, but I will never feel comfortable enough with them to be honest about my mental health. I feel like a ticking timebomb with no relief.I do not know any other way to say this. I just do not like my friends anymore. I have wanted to change as a person and I think that they are holding me back. I have just known them for so long and it would be a really scummy thing to do to just leave.\\n\\nI do not know what to do. I feel like a terrible person for thinking this. How should I go about solving this?I am a 17 year old athlete with 0 marketable skills. For the last 2 years I have sat on my ass being lazy and smoking weed. I do not care about sports anymore. I realized that they are absolutely meaningless and I want to have a very successful career in business. I switched up my goals at 16 but it was already too late to get ahead. Because the leading people in their respective industries were not being lazy at 15, they were working hard and planning out their careers. At 14 I was wasting my time trying to become a pro athlete instead of thinking about my actual career. At 13 I had absolutely 0 vision and perspective about life. I have not done any of that realistic planning and I do not even know where to start and I fear it is too late for me because I only have 1 year left. I am so stressed I feel it all on my shoulders, my entire future riding on my self worth.recently I have been having a lot of issues with some less than fun memories.\\n\\n**Sexual assault below** \\n\\nI was sexually assaulted when I was in 6th grade I was 11, maybe 12 at the time, it was in public by a peer and I knew other people who watched it happen but no one did or said anything so I did the same and at the time I never felt like it had not hurt me or anything, I did not see my body any differently I did not blame myself, nothing, I just passed it off and moved on with my life and that was fine...\\n\\n**Drugs below**\\n\\nBut eventually I kinda thought about it and it all came crashing down, the realization of how much it actually did hurt me but I pushed it all deep down as a reflex and had no clue I was even doing it, as first I tried to get my mind off it with drugs, mainly weed, and at the lowest point when I was going to give up on myself, LSD, now for the average, healthy, responsible adult both drugs will not because any physical damage as long as it was done in a safe place but both drugs were done when I was between 12 and 13 and only 2 or 3 I did drugs was I in a safe place and luckily the time I did LSD I was at least unable to hurt myself and did not want to hurt others but I was at school.\\n\\n**suic\\\\*de below**\\n\\nThe day I did LSD I planed to go home that night and commit suic\\\\*de but when I arrived at school a friend asked if I wanted to do LSD I said yes because I figured \"what do I have to lose?\" I was coming down from my high as I went home and by the time I arrived I was exhausted and ended up sleeping all day and into the next morning and had missed my only chance for months to come.\\n\\n **s\\\\*lf h\\\\*arm below**\\n\\nSo I moved onto the next coping mechanism I could think of which was self harm but after almost being caught time and time again, constantly needing to clean blood covered things, and my familys growing suspicion I had to give that up too which I wish I could say was for the best.\\n\\n**eating disorder below**\\n\\nThe last thing I tried before I shoved the memory into the deepest part of my mind was to get a grip, have control over the one thing I could, what I ate, I knew right away that I wanted to starve myself unlike most stories of anorexia it did not start as a diet, it started as eating as little as I could physically get away with, I managed to get down to 89 pounds before I passed out after not eating or 4 days whilst still burning over 2,000 calories a day with my active life style, sadly no one noticed do to the fact that I had told the only person that was home I was going to take a shower moments before passing out on my bed room floor luckily I was not out for very long and I was so scared by it that I ate right away and have been trying to get better for years but I keep relapsing.\\n\\nI bring this up because the memory has resurfaced and I do not know what to do with itWhat are some healthy but not hokey ways folks are coping with Corona related depression? When you are forced to be isolated and distanced from others? I  can not get out of bed most days. I find myself tearing up and crying frequently. I feel hopeless and unmotivated - I can not concentrate on anything. \\n\\nI am lucky - I have a job and I can work from home, better than so many people. But I need to KEEP my job.\\n\\nI usually cope with depression by staying busy and active in my hobbies, visiting friends. Distracting!  Hard to so that now being stuck inside all day, everyday. \\n\\nHelp.How many others struggle with self care? \\nDue to this quarantine and school being out, I can not work so my self care is even worse lately. \\nI have been in the same clothes for 4 days. I feel so disgusting yet I have absolutely no motivation to even get up and change and take a shower. \\nI hate this.Many times I feel pain or pressure on my shoulders, like 6 days a week. Some days it got worse like I carried the whole damn world on my shoulders and nothing can help it goes away. \\n\\nI wonder if this is because of depression or not. What do you think?Yo, currently conflicted between what feels like two worlds.\\n\\nI am trying to figure a way to give my life a meaning, because I am currently stuck with \"if I did that, then it means that I would lie to myself. I would be living a lie that I, myself created. For the purpose of not feeling depressed anymore, would not I fall back to the hole I dug myself in when the time comes?\"\\nSo for the time being, life does not have meaning.\\n\\nI have always hated feeling emotions, some 20 odd years later and I am still \"discovering\" new ones that I have seemed to ignore and suppress.\\nStill wondering if there is a way to shut them down, see if that is better. Managed a few times, but it is not consistent and not long enough for me to wonder if I could be like that for the rest of my life. \\nTo be frank I sometimes scare myself, I sometimes need to calm myself down.\\n\\nStill trying to figure if I should tap in on my emotions and actually try to connect with a friend or a family member. I have always thought that to have a connection, you would relate to one another, two distinguished lives having the same thoughts and feelings about the topics one would talk about, not completely identical, but enough to make you feel related as if you felt a connection right then and there.\\n\\nAnd bunch of other things.. I feel that this is long enough.\\n\\nAnd for the grand finale, life and death.\\nI have always perceived living as weird.\\nI still think about us being a side effect of whatever the hell this reality is supposed to be. And worse, if it had purpose. Why would that be? How would it work out? Who or what would be our purpose to fulfill?\\nAnd also, why was it me that got in the egg in the first place? Why was not it, and please excuse me, a single sperm, not me, that could have gotten there first?\\nIt just does not make sense to me. What are the chances of us being conscious and shit wtf.\\nGetting a weird frame of mind, hope today was better than last night everyone.Hello reddit, I have been in a relationship with my gf for almost 6 years now. we have been on and off, for the last 2 years I struggled with addiction (It was not that bad, just got hooked to coke and spent most of my money and time partying hard). I have been clean for almost 5 months now. Today we got in an argument and she completly destroyed me, she said I have always harrased her for sex because I was to insistent when she said no. She said all my friends were terrible, she said I was lazy, I had no future, etc. To be honest, this kinda made me realize all of this is true. I have been lying to myself for years now thinking I was a good person, a good boyfriend, a good friend, a good son. It all feels like a lie now. I have struggled with depression before but today it is getting harder. I can not stop thinking about taking my life. Feeling like there is no point anymore, I am trash and the world would be probably better without me.One day i will pull the trigger but today I will just put It to my head.I recently graduated college, and all I got for the last five months of my life is \"we have decided to pursue other candidates.\" emails. I have felt nothing but defeat since I graduated, and with the recent plague it is even harder to find hiring organizations.  How do I believe in myself again?They asked for times we would be available and I assume we will just get a call individually.\\n\\nI have been furloughed and am on an on call basis. I have worked one day in the past several weeks. We have customers who need our products for medical things so certain products are essential. I am responsible for preparing materials for the assemblers. That being said I was told last week they have enough material and that I might have to come in for just one product which is what I took care of the one day I have worked. I have no idea what this email is about and am worried they will be asking me to come back sooner than planned. (we have been furloughed till May.) I am trying to just hope for the best. I have no clue what they want to talk about \\n\\nI got to say I have absolutely no desire to go back. I worked yesterday and I do not know how I put myself through that on a daily basis. \\n\\nI hate my job but am grateful for it, and am aware of how this whole thing affects others negatively. I do not wish harm on anyone. I have made other posts about this so I will not explain my disclaimer anymore lol.\\n\\nThe point is I did not get anything done today and am worried that tomorrow I will be too anxious to get anything done and that I will have to go back to work sooner than expected and then I really will not be able to get anything done. I am going to try to sleep but that is been difficult for me lately. This anxiety will not help. \\n\\nI feel pathetic for how much I do not want to work and honestly mentally can not handle a full time 9-5. I feel there are things so deeply engrained in me that keep me from being a functioning, valuable member of society.I was starting to feel happy, like I was able to do what I needed to be done to figure things out and get over some people. I was able to call friends and have a happy conversation instead of depressing ones. I was playing Xbox with my friends and genuinely enjoyed myself. Then my parents decided that staying up till 4am enjoying myself was not normal. After I was doing that for 3 weeks and they knew I was doing it the entire time. Now since they decided that i was no longer normal they decided to do a strict “school schedule” while at home so they will plan when I wake up, when I eat, when I do online work, what I do in my “personal granted free time”. MY BODY STILL is not USED TO NOT GOING TO BED AT 4AM SO I do not GET TIRED TILL THEN SO I GET 3 HOURS OF SLEEP SND THEY will not LET ME NAP. it is been happening for a week now. They act like it is bringing our family together but me and my sister just hide in our rooms and that makes them unsettled. They also have scheduled times to go for a walk and to do a hand picked chore when there practically are not any left. I do not see why they are doing this and I have not done anything wrong. I just want to go to work and watch my shows in piece. This is all so frustratingEver since last year I have felt myself going down a deep decline in my mental health. I did acid about 7 months ago with someone I am no longer friends with because everyone around me was telling me that she was toxic for me. I eventually see a therapist because my friends recommended I do as I tended to lash out at them. The therapist tells me that I have PTSD. I have lost all of my friends because I think that they are all less mature than me and that I have outgrown all of them. The only reason I stick around is because I will be alone and I will blame myself. I see the world so differently, I know acid and my (current) weed usage that my mother is actually okay with. She allows me to smoke weed because she thinks it is helping with my anxiety. I try to convince myself it does not but deep down I know it is. I tried hydrocodone after fucking stealing from my grandpa\\'s cabinet. I do not know if I am a teenager acting out, or if something is seriously wrong with me. I am failing school, literally. All F\\'s and I have had all F\\'s since 6th grade. Yet for some reason they never decided to hold me back. I wish they did, because now I am the really dumb freshman who is always missing school and smokes weed. I do not want to be known as that. My therapist tells me that I am actually quite intelligent for my age. This quarantine has really been messing me up even more. I came in contact with weed again, I can not talk to my therapist anymore because of it, I am eating more food, I lost my routine and stay up all hours of the night, and worst of all is that I have not done a sliver of my home school work. I know I am fucking up, everyone I ask this to tells me that I will be okay and that I should not worry. But I know they are lying, I wish I was not treated like such a fucking child. My dad has sending me voicemails saying that he is out of jail and talking to me like I am still 10 years old. I do not know how to respond to him because I do not know him at all, all he used to do with me as a kid was do everything for me. But not actually letting me figure anything out on my own, same with my mom. Speaking of my mom, since I am the only one living with her in a 2 bedroom apartment I realized that I have been through torture for so long. The name calling she does, I get called dumb, stupid, and a pig for no reason, she makes all of these mean noises when I even try to talk to her. My therapist tells me it is her way of coping with her own insecurities because she used to be overweight and some people do say she is a bit of an airhead. Lastly, I think I have realized that I have so much more stuff to go through. I thought I had the answer to everything, I thought I was psychic. I still sometimes think I am. And after looking at all of this your only question is probably \"how have you not killed yourself yet?\" and I do not know. I do not want to kill myself, I just would not care if I died because I provide nothing either way. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n(I might do edits on this because I just need to let everything out. I am sorry if the grammar is bad or weird)\\n\\n**TLDR:** My life has gone to shit and I have no idea how I can recover. Venting about various subjects including failing all my classes, my dad & mom, my ~~toxic~~ friends, my addiction to weed, and my therapist.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Added some stuffI am just unsure about everything. Who I am, what I want to do, if people who say they love me really mean it. it is driving me crazy. Like I do not even know if my gf really means it when she says it. I do not want to be like this. But I can not help it and it is killing me.Most nights I sit awake in my bed and just wish to be dead, that I just disappear and be gone. Wish I did not care about anyone else wish I could just do it, but I can not/will not. Why you might ask. Welp I will tell you. The pain I deal with on the daily is not enjoyable but it is mine and ik I can atleast contain it and keep living but if I killed my self then the pain would be passed to everyone close to me and idk how they would cope. In the end me staying alive in this hell is better for everyone else if that makes senseMost nights I sit awake in my bed and just wish to be dead, that I just disappear and be gone.

In the end me staying alive in this hell is better for everyone else if that makes senseHi,\\n\\nMy name is Jarred and over the last year in my life I have had an ongoing issue of anxiety and depression. I began therapy for anxiety in October of this year which lead to a big drop in my overall anxiety, but I never really brought up depression, as I thought these feelings had direct correlation to my anxiety. However, as therapy went on I soon realized that my depression was an independent issue. But I decided not to bring it up as my mom, who put me into therapy (I was 17 at the time), and my therapist both believed my life was changing for the better and I was a much happier person. The whole goal of therapy was to get my anxiety ready for me to move out and go to college come August and in the eyes of my therapist and mother, I have reached that point.\\n\\nFast forward to today. I recently started dating a girl I met at work and our relationship has surpassed any expectations I had for it. I am very happy to say I love my girlfriend and she makes me very happy. However, my depression really drags me down at times and I have constant feelings that I am worthless and I will often feel insecure about myself. I have very few friends and at times I feel like I have nobody in my life. The only person I have to turn to when I am feeling this way is my girlfriend. While she makes me feel much better about myself and cares a ton about my mental health, I feel like I vent to her too much and if I countinue like this she will end up leaving me. So I resort to crying by myself and feeling like total shit. I do not know where these feelings come from or what to do, and I feel just as lonely as I did before I had my girlfriend sometimes. Please give me any advice you feel could help my situation. Thanks.I am 24 and I can not think of anything that would make me happier than not existing... the only thing I have ever wanted in this world is love and I know I am not worth loving. Maybe I will die from a sickness or something soon since I am too much of a bitch to kill myself now. Hope does not exist in my life. Only darkness and waiting.I am having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just do not feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just do not understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I am unhappy and miserable, what I am saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can not separate the two. On top of that, there is this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I have always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I am this 21 year old uni student. And I have been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I have always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I have become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. that is not to say I am suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I am not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I have made my point clear. I am not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. \\nI truly appreciate it.Personally for me, my mood completely changes to me being sad and on the verge of tears whenever i see or hear mostly anything related to relationships and dating.Hard times like these weed out the people who do not care from the people who care. It weeds out the people who need you from the people who want you.\\n\\nAnd yet here I am, left with nobody. Partially my fault, partially just the way things are. \\n\\nEnding my life seems even more inconsequential now.Is life really worth living. Yes we all have dreams. But majority of it will never happen. Whether it is money we will never have. Or a love we will never experience. I can only imagine a reason to live. We all experience different hardships. Some more toxic and terrifying than others. How we handle it is different, but is the pain and torment worth it. Super depressed and mentally unstable. Just a little suicidalwhenever I vent to people or ask them for help i feel guilty and I feel like I am taking advantage of them or guilt tripping them. I really hate asking people for help or just venting. I have not been able to see my girlfriend recently either so now things are really getting bad but I feel guilty venting to her because again, I feel like I am taking advantage of her and just trying to hear what I want because I am making her feel bad for me. i do not even know half the time if I am genuinely asking for help or just trying to make them feel bad for meI have asthma and work in healthcare, and everywhere on the media, it says asthmatics are at a greater risk of complications. I was excited because I thought of this being a legitimate way out. I got the virus at work of course, have been feeling awful since the end of last month, and I am sad to say that I am past the point of danger. I am being treated for pneumonia at home, and I hate to say it, but I am recovering. I really wished that this would be how my life ends, but I am not that lucky. I wanted to leave with people thinking I fought hard while I had the chance, not looking at it like I failed, how they probably will after I succumb to depression, whenever that may be. \\n\\nI am really sorry to those of you who have family members gravely I will or have passed, I do not wish this on anybody except myself. I hope this post does not seem disrespectful.I never really was depressed i just had really bad anxiety.. i was taking Effexor and it was not helping my anxiety so i got put on Zoloft but now it seems like my anxiety is worse and I have been so depressed lately and just down and i do not even really know why. \\nI have a video appointment with my therapist to discuss my meds Tuesday, any suggestions.I really do not know what else to say other than that. I really can hardly talk to someone without getting pissed or start rambling coherently. it is like, everything in real life, the world, and stress of having to live alone with a family who are pushing me against a wall when it comes to mental health.\\n\\nTo put it mildly, I feel like I am starting to lose it, mind-wise. Perhaps it is just a side-effect of being Depressed in general, or maybe I am going Clinically Insane. Wow. that is fucking wonderful, is not it?I (24M) have felt the urge to comment on things on social media to get a reaction out of someone, in hopes their reaction releases what is clogged in my head. I am not commenting anything mean, I just have the urge to comment on a lot of things. Like if someone posts something that may not make sense to me, I feel like I have to comment. A part of me thinks I am doing it to prevent myself from going back into my depression. Maybe I do not know how to let things go, maybe I have nothing going on in my life, maybe I am just looking for someone to care. I really do not know. And when I do comment I get anxious and get scared to open the app. But the relief after a sharp reaction from someone eases my brain. Like I can physically feel it. Feels like something has been snapped which then releases a flood of fluid. I also think I am acting out of fear. But fear of what? Lastly I did start therapy this week.I am too far gone now. I can not feel anything anymore.  I look inside myself to try to find something, anything, that tells me I am alive. But all I feel is the need to die, or to just not exist anymore. I have nothing left but the hot coals of rage and the cool icy feeling of numbness. There is nothing else...I am beyond saving.Can anyone relate to this?  I have desires to do things but I can never bring myself to actually do any of them.  Boredom is not affecting me like it does all of my peers.  I do not find myself feeling restless at all.  I do not feel tired of staying inside or just using my phone, I think it is because I am so conditioned to being exhausted and never doing anything else.  \\nI can not describe exactly my feelings on this subject but hopefully someone in the comments might relate and understand better.M24. In law school. Life sucks. Quality of life is on the decline. Compared to past generationts we are producing more and more wealth for our corporate overlords while quality of life continues to fall. Bad enough. Due to COVID, I am now unemployed this summer and had to move back in with my parents. Hate it. Compeltely feels like everything I ever worked for is pointless. That I am back at square one.\\n\\nLive in Canada but of South Asian Muslim background. South Asian Muslim culture is f*cked up. Teens and young adults are infantilized. Really not good for one\\'s self-esteem and sense of self worth. I was a devout Muslim in my teens. Left the faith about 4 years ago. I believe in creator and I do believe in certain religious values but I do not believe in Islam or in any particular religion. Honestly, I abhor Islam. The God of Islam is harsh and cruel and has ridiculous demands. Full rigidity. No Flexibility. Like starting in 10 days I have to spend a month starving and dehydrating myself to appease a psychotic God who will severely punish me if I do not. It spikes my depression. And since I am unemployed at stuck at home, I really have to sneak to cheat. And I feel bad doing it when my family is fasting. My dad is really religious and I have a super religious grandma (typical stereotype) so religion is a dominant topic in the house. I also have objections to its truth claims, I just in good conscience cannot accept Muhammed as an infallible final prophet and a source of moral authority\\n\\nI have never really had it great. Never really had friends growing up outside of a couple family friends. did not really make friends till undergrad, and the first group of friends I made turned out to be sociopaths out to get me. I have some friends now. I am also close to my little cousins but they live abroad so I cannot really be in contact with them. Of course, my extended family are all mostly practicing Muslims as well so I cannot really have an honest relationship w/ them and I worry about the future. Either I have to pretend to be a Muslim, end up in a loveless arranged marriage, and keep familial ties. Or I officially leave the faith and destroy my family.\\n\\nIn my 4th year of undergrad (2017-2018) I fell in love with someone who was everything I ever wanted in a partner. Successful, moral, life-partner type, virign, great with kids (all of which I bring to the table). Everything I was looking for. She also was, as a bonus, from a well-of finally and beautiful. She was what it seemed to be a true happily ever after. I had suffered a lot and worked hard in life. My family is not poor (though we were that when we were younger) but we are not rich. My undergrad college though was full of rich, white private school kids. I put in a lot of effort to get where I am at (my resume is stellar and I had to overcome a lot of barriers to get there). The idea that my effort paid of and I could marry a rich white private school girl was a dream come true. She and I got along very well. She was kind hearted. I really thought I had found my match. But for whatever reason, she rejected me. My entirety of everything I worked so hard toward my whole life for - my happily ever after (and yes I know no marriage is truly like that) taken away from me.\\nI have not been able to find anyone like her. And even worse, because I am male, I have been attacked instead of given sympathy. The dating system is rigged against men. Men are systematically oppressed by women into making the first move. Into taking the emotional burden. Into being and acting a certain way and catering to women\\'s views. Women claim to believe in equality but sure do not act it, by holding men to traditional gender roles while they themselves have been freed from it. Men are still statistically seen as ATMs and providers. And this has bene shown from what people have told me. People have attacked me for wanting a fair deal. That because I am a man I have to be open to marrying down. That despite all the barriers I overcame, I have to be open to marrying someone who has it easier and did not accomplish as much, ruining all the effort I made in life. That because of my gender, it is my fault she rejected me because I did not \"ask her out correctly\" or whatever BS hoops men are expected to jump through. (I do not see how it should make a difference but apparently it does. Must be nice being a privelged woman). As a man, I am told that I must just accept a woman who slept around and then wants to settle later in life. does not matter that I come in with purity and certain values. That I have to accept nonense. She did not go down 2 steps to be with me, and her things were based on privilege of birth, not effort or morals. But I am expected to go down 20 steps to be with whomever\\n\\nShe also was a Catholic. So when I fell for her I started looking into the faith and I found a different kind of God. A loving God. I was so close to converting. If I actually married her, I would have converted. But I do not think the faith is true either. Sure I like things about it, but if it were true God would have given me way in, I.e. that woman\\'s love. Again I thought I found happiness but it was taken away from me. \\n\\nI just want someone who loves me unconditionally for whom I am. My parents do not due to faith. So unlike most of the world, I do not have that. I do not have true love. Which is why I can never be happy. And it seems that men do not get true love. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. That men do get valued beyond being resources for women, but it does not seem like that.\\n\\nI would love to be a rich western culture woman. Get the best of everything. I encountered many of them at undergrad, living the dream life. It would be great to have parents accept you for who you are. It would be great to have financial oppurnity. To have tons of self-esteem boosts from suitors. To have true love and relationship dynamics rigged in your favour. I love kids, if I was a woman I could get either get a one night stand (though that kind of behavior is not my thing) or go to a sperm bank and get a kid. As a man, I must commit to a woman and hope she does not divorce and take the kids. More stress, less options\\n\\nI really hate who I am. I wish I were a rich western woman. Living that happy life. Instead I am cursed. Never fully accepted by my family. Raised in a f*cked up religion / culture. Oppressed via society due to my gender. Never get true love and be loved unconditionally for who I am. Quite likely never get kids. Never get happiness. And will just suffer, working as a corporate slave till I die.\\n\\nSorry for the rambling. Thanks for lsiteningSometimes I feel like I come across as cold to people. They get used to this fake persona that I present, then when I am not pushing it people will tell me I seem cold or calm. I do not know what you want? I am trying my best? I just feel empty sometimes. Life seems pointless sometimes. Sorry my emptiness is showing. I do not even know anymore.there is a part of me that justs whishes id catch the coronavirus just so it will all end i am tired and i am ready to die. I feel as though i havw nothing left and that i have never mattered to anyone untill i had nothing left. For so many years i shruged off the abuse of always being told i am not good enough that i do not mesure up that i am a loser. Well you guys won i believe it now. And now you tell me i matter and all the little things i do are achievements but its to late i welcome death it be a belessing for it to end yet i can not bring myself to commit scuicide for some reason but if the covid could take me out id be okay with that ...Ever since the quarantine, I have been living in my bedroom mostly doing nothing. My family, friends and unknown numbers keep on calling me. I did not open my message at all for 2 weeks. Now my siblings are pissed off at me and they even said my friends are looking for me and asked me to open my message. I am scared to open my message and there is this unknown number that keep on calling me everyday. I want to answer it but I get nervous breakdown when I see the number. Idk why and it is killing me because I feel like this call is important but I just can not do it. I want to disappearI did pass with many life obstacles throw my young life ( mom being sick since i joined college and my professors and mates was censured me cuz they think i m just lazy while i was always with mom in hospital , i was just trying to deal with that but reality i getting destroyed inside from the first on my class to someone pass her year with prayers .. just it is out of my hands ) which changed me 100% from a strong will-ed person who is really so powerful and clever to someone who depresses her own , i was so clever and i think i still but same time i say i can not .. for wat i need to do my best , I do not really has this passion to live or feel like i want to do something good even for my own , i did fail many time to be the best cuz i m only scared of failure like a fool , i see ppl around me getting better grades they try hard really to get it and they envy me for having the abilities but i just do not have the passion for it not anymore , they keep throwing hard words and climb over me with dirty doings and i just keep failing and idc about beating them too , and now it is my graduation project and i stopped working on it cuz of those feelings controlling me .. btw my mom was always sad cuz she has a hand on wot had happened to me and she was forcing me stupidly to do my best which affected me so bad without her notice ( and i never blame her in my deep heart ) , less than month for it and i keep watching anime play video games and cry inside but really it is hard to fightKind of in a low spot right now and would really like to talk to someone who could help me. I do not have anyone close to me that I can talk to..everything is getting worse. I have already been dealing with wanting to kill myself every god damn day for like the past year. I have been trying to break up with my boyfriend who refuses to leave, and he says if he leaves hes going to kill himself. my little brother got into a car accident on easter and is pretty much needing our 24/7 care. I have relapsed which does not help anymore. i just want xans but then i feel like the only person i want will leave. i do not know what the fuck to do.I am sure you have all seen this post before, and I have read every one like it on this sub out of desperation.. but i really can not do it anymore and i have to say something\\n\\nmy inadequate penis has brought me so much shame and feelings of worthlessness throughout my life and it is only gotten worse. these past few months it has gotten completely unbearable. i avoid urinating and showering because i do not want to see it.. it does not leave my mind for a moment and i find myself being thrown into these uncontrollable crying fits at night.. it does not help that I am a 26 almost 27 year old neet never been able to hold down a job for more than a few months due to who the fuck knows what. plagued with horrible depression and anxiety, ADHD.\\n\\n have 0 friends, never been in a relationship and I am finding myself losing it with the realization that I will never experience being wanted, or desired, or satisfying a woman.. to see the look of excitement in her eyes when she sees your big penis must be so great. \\n\\nthe only advice people seem to give is to basically distract her from your penis with good oral.. and hopefully try and forget about the 8\" silicone penis underneath her bed that she turns to when she wants to feel good. this life is so fucked and it is only getting worse. if i had any courage at all i would end it.I am a high school senior and I have had depression in my life since I was in the 2nd and the reason today just took a turn for the worse and I got in an argument with them because they are trying the best to force religion on me and because I have a big family who are all super religious I feel like a outcast all the time. Even now I can hear my family outside laughing and having fun while I am here crying. Because of quarantine i am home all the time and I feel like an outcast in my house and the only people who I feel close to are my friends and even though I try my best to talk with them it is not going good because of this quarantine. And I am pretty sure that the closest person in my family now dislikes me. My family try’s to show me as the bad kid to my younger siblings by saying things like do not end up like me and that I am a bad influence ( which I can sorta understand because I have also went and thought it was a good idea and tell my parents about how I smoke weed to help cope and now I am the pot head in the family) I am sorry that this is long but I just wanted someone to hear me out so thank you.i even started liking the way all my removed yet posts were ignored. like i know there are so many and the time i post something is... depends on were are you from, for me it is now 4:30 morning; but it only makes me feel more and more sure (like i did not reach it yet) about my wothlessness.\\nthe way i want to hide everything deep inside and scream it at someones face at the same time...\\nwhy am i still alive? why can not i just go sleep and do not wake up?I have a long history with the Mental Health industry. Multiple therapists, multiple trips to the stability ward, multiple different medications. I have heard everything, seemingly, that those things can say, because they keep repeating themselves:\\n\\n>\"every experience strengthens you\"\\n>\\n>\"it gets better eventually\"\\n>\\n>\"this medicine will help\"\\n>\\n>\"you are valuable\"\\n\\nTo say I have had a \"bad\" experience with the Mental Health industry is disingenuous. All my former counselors are good people. but interacting with them does not go anywhere. My past has *not* strengthened me. It has *not* gotten better. The medicine did *not* help. I am *not* valuable. And please, do not bother disagreeing with that last one in the comments. That\\'ll save us both some energy and time. that is not the point of the post, I have spent far too much energy and time discussing that with the  Mental Health industry. Thanks.\\n\\nI have long held the position that if I ever end up in the hospital again, I would never leave. because there is no growth, no plan for my future or any future. no hope for me. This is where I am, and I can not get better or worse, I can only *appear* differently, and only in the short term. Even that I think is lost for me because I can not pretend anymore. I can not pretend that this is not how things are, and can not pretend that this is not how things will be.\\n\\nSo why am I here? because in all that I have experienced, no one has agreed with me, ever. no one has actually considered or entertained my position. no one has said *\"you are right, 14ierophant: that life sucks, that you are going to die, and that everything would be better if it happened soon. ****In the meantime, here\\'s what you can do****.\"*\\n\\nAnd that is what I am looking for. I do not need a cure, I do not need to change who I am, I do not need to be happy. we are so far beyond happy at this point, trust me. I just need a reason to do something, anything, in a world where nothing has value. Where do I turn to find that? What box do I check and on which form? Who do I hire or ask?I am only ever truly calm and at rest when I am alone. I have realised that I am not fully comfortable with anyone. Not my friends, not my boyfriend, not even my family. I always feel the need to deliver. I have to provide something otherwise they will get tired of me. it is just easier by myself. When there is no pressure to be interesting or engaging.\\n\\nI remember growing up, I would constantly change myself to suit who I was with. I would change my personality for the sake of getting along with someone. Now, I feel like I do not really have a personality. I bore myself with things I say and I find myself annoying. I am not funny at all and I am not intelligent or knowledgable and I have nothing witty or wise to say.\\n\\nFor these reasons I do not really talk. I struggle with one-on-one conversations with another person. So, I can forget about group conversations or mealtime chit chat. I just do not have anything to add. I can not even bring myself to answer the door or pick up the phone.\\n\\nRecently I have noticed that I am distancing myself a lot. I do not reach out to my friends. The conversations I have with my boyfriend these days are very repetitive and I am worried that he will get bored of me and realise that I am not as interesting as he thought. Because when he sees past his rose coloured glasses and notices that I am not as exciting as he thought, he will leave. he is the most meaningful person in my life.\\n\\nI have never been super close to my parents. My mum even confronted me recently about how “I do not even want to be her friend”. I feel terrible and she seemed hurt but honestly, I do not think I can ever fully open up to someone. Not even my mum. I do not think she would would not like me. We are very different.\\n\\nI am scared that when I transition to a new school in September, I will be too guarded to even try and interact with people. Then I will get left behind and have to spend the next two years without anyone.\\n\\nI do not know. I reading this and I feel like I am probably making a mountain of a molehill. Oh well, at least I got it out.Note: Coming back after writing this, I realize I kinda get all over the place for me. I would appreciate if you stick with me and keep reading through. Thanks.\\n\\nHey, I do not really know how to start this, but I feel like I might be depressed, but I do not know if it is just a \"Boo-hoo, I have a small problem in my life and I am now depressed,\" which I really hate and do not want to be (I remember doing something like this where I was making jokes about depression and saying I had it - this felt this was definitely faked looking back, and I feel like a complete asshole for doing that, especially to a person who actually has depression (it almost felt like I was making fun of depression) - this is something I will hate myself forever for doing and wish I could take back so bad - I really do not want to relapse onto this behavior - I might have been doing this for the attention, but I really was not sure why I did this at the time). Basically, I \\\\*really\\\\* do not want to be a dick, and part of me keeps telling myself I am really just faking all of this.\\n\\nI have been questioning myself about this often now, I tried denying it to myself, but I do not know.\\n\\nRecently I feel like I just stopped caring for some things, especially school-work. I know I used to get anxious if I did not turn stuff in the day it was due, or that I need to study for a particular assessment, but recently, I had that feeling disappear. I keep pushing deadlines, and I have tonnes of stuff to make up, but I have not felt the same tension to work that I used to (this is something my mom pointed out) - making me feel lazier. I often now go into class without finishing assignments, pushing them back forever. And also, I feel a severe lack of motivation to do this work - I am always procrastinating by watching YouTube or whatever. This made my grade drop by a lot - I usually get pretty good grades (A-B), but my last semester has been complete shit (A-C - and low C because I have not turned things in). This is making me worry I could lose my honors classes, which I really do not want to lose and is something I am stressed out about. These grades are not me, and my parents are saying I should drop these classes (which I really do not want to). I feel like it is easy and I can do it, but my grade does not paint the same picture. I want to be able to do my work, and get my grade up, but I just can not motivate myself anymore - or something is going on but I am not sure. Yet, I am also scared as hell about losing my classes. I just do not get it.\\n\\nThis lack of working has given extreme frustration from my parents. It feels like everyday I am getting yelled at for not doing my work, or at least doing enough. And when I do some of it, I have so much to catch up on, so ultimately it feels like I barely did anything, and I feel like my parents think the same, even though I sometimes spend hours catching up (also counting for when I distract myself on whatever), I get nothing - no break - no time to relax - and have to use means that I am not allowed to do to get something (like procrastinating even more or staying up late). My mom brought up concerns about a possible attention disorder, but I pushed it aside. After all, I do not want to be the kid with an attention disorder, now do I? It feels like an endless cycle I can not break.\\n\\nMy grades and all that jazz has lead me to lose a lot of my electronics as well. The thing is, I always feel like I really want to do something, like maybe play a game, make a video, anything inspiring, and I just can not because I am fucking grounded. I want to go and play something on my console, because I feel like I can be happy doing that (and is something I really enjoyed), but I can not because I had that taken for saying some nasty stuff (I will touch up on this later). I also had (right now) my phone taken for, literally no reason. I know this sounds really cliche and stupid, but I feel like the things that make me happy or bring me joy are all gone. Maybe I am being a whiny teenager who just is not thankful enough...\\n\\nI also found myself getting a lot more aggressive and angry. My dad has always been a bit shouty and aggressive. He can never command me to do something while also being nice - he always rudely tells me to do whatever. I have lately been whispering stuff back (i.e: Fuck you, What an asshole, etc.) I have not always been this aggressive, but I feel myself going there. And going purely based on emotion, I fucking hate him - he can not ever leave me alone and give me privacy, and he is such an asshole by taking shit whenever he feels like it with no justification needed. He is always asking about my homework, and making it seem like I put less effort than what I really did. He keeps bringing up my work, always telling me off about it, and it is not doing me any good, and I am getting to a point where I can not fucking stand it. (Sorry, I needed that rant - I do not know if I really meant any of it - maybe I am just a normal teen going through teen stuff). I also see myself seething at trivial things, for example, right now when people are coming in my room while writing this, or when my room door was forced wide open by my parents to check in my work while writing this (probably because I want to keep this secret from them - I will dive into this later). I do not know why I am doing this, and it is all probably going worse with the quarantine.\\n\\nI have seen myself going to the bathroom to just sit there in silence and sadness and just feeling horrible in general (usually after my dad has decided to yell at me or whatever), and bleary eyed, have to forcibly tell myself over and over again, \"I am okay.\" before I can come back out. This has been happening quite a lot.\\n\\nRecently, I had an event of me just crying for no explainable reason. I went into my room and started crying. I tried to deny this. When my dad came in and asked what was wrong, he came in angry and shouting about it, and when I could not tell him, he got more and more furious (it almost felt like he was forced to come in - not doing this because he genuinely wanted to). My dad left out of anger and frustration, to where my mom came in and, well, just handled it a lot better. This happened once. Later in the day, my mom asked if I was depressed, to where I did not know what to answer with, so I just said no (while kinda laughing it off).\\n\\nI also caught myself eating more. Like, going into the kitchen to grab a snack for no reason. I am not even hungry - and (context - am already a bit chubby) feel really unhealthy and bad about it. I do not know why I do this.\\n\\nAll these issues have all been highlighted and intensified by the quarantine we are having - especially not being able to go out (as it feels like going to school really helped me with this stuff - it was a place to get away from my parents).\\n\\n\\\\*These next two things are something I am going to find really difficult talking about (I really tried to avoid talking about these things), and frankly, I am not comfortable having online, but screw it, here it goes.\\\\*\\n\\nI have recently been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have been visualizing myself dead. Of course, I do not really want to die, but I have been thinking about it a lot - probably too much. I have also done self harm before and recently (cutting my leg), but that was either for me lashing out onto myself, or attention, or maybe both. I do not know. When my parents found out, I wanted comfort, but instead I got a yelling. I also had an incident where I was close to suicide (the issue was frankly, really dumb and it was probably more for attention than anything else), but I knew I did not really want to die.\\n\\nI also have an avid masturbation/porn addiction. it is really not doing my any well. My parents found out about this, and they (currently) are not that suspicious of it, but truly, I still have been doing it. I really hate this part of me, and want to change, but I keep relapsing. I know it is wrong (that is what religion says (plus that lives will be terrible with people who follow this path - which I am worried now that is applied to me)). I hope this is not what brings me to hell (which speaking of, I also lately have not been praying all that much, so that may also be a because).\\n\\nThis has all taken me forever to write, and now that I just finished pouring my heart out, I should probably say I have not told anyone all of this. Anyone. I am scared of having depression (I do not want to have it - it would suck to be known as the one depressed kid), I do not want to go through therapy, and I do not fancy telling very many people this. I want to be normal.\\n\\nI think I got everything, but I may come back to this if I feel like I missed talking about something. If you actually bothered reading through this mess, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just felt like I needed to let this all out - everything that has been bothering me - and I really appreciate you reading this. <3\\n\\nEdit: added random crying + mom asking + some extra bits in the section i do not want to talk about^((hello again, I was so humbled and appreciative of all the feedback on my first post here last time. I do not talk on Reddit. I have under 2k karma and 5y+ account. I have been lurking my entire life because of anxiety of posting anything or entering a conversation or just too depressed to even think of contributing. for the first time, on my first entry, i felt so happy.))\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI just lived with it. I fully expected be walking barefoot on dog treat crumbs and papers and dust and clutter. \\n\\nOver the past year my kitchen has been filling with cardboard and garbage. I estimate I have taken out 10-12 trash bags over the past month or so. I have had a string of good days and feel like I can do normal person things! \\n\\nThis time last year I was in rehab for alcohol. I lost 4 years of my life drinking to isolate and medicate my depression. Couple that with having a undefined sleep disorder hypersomnia type which makes me able to sleep for ten, twelve, sixteen hours no problem! I can sleep anywhere. On the floor. Concrete. You know how I Found out? I fell into micro-sleep last year driving 55mph at 4:30 am to work (thankfully no one else on the road) and drove off the road smashing a road sign on my side. I woke up and corrected and all that happened was that my mirror got yeeted into the forest. I can not afford a new one. It looks like shit.I have seen this movie 1000 times but it is never hit me like this Scarecrow always had a brain the lion always had courageAnd the tin man always had a heart\\n\\nI have been in a place where I do not think I have any of those things and hearing someone say oh no you always had it the whole time just ripped me to shreds and made me break down cryingJust because. I took one yesterday and now I am debating on taking one tonight. \\n\\nI just want to feel and smell good with my favorite stuff. \\n\\nFeels good.I am never good enough for anyone. People get bored with fast and leave. My mother tells me I fat and I should stop eating so much. I am just so tired of work and school. Stress has made me sick and weak. I just need someone to stay, and not just talk to me and then up and leave forever.I am starting to feel as if nothing matters anymore. I could go outside and go on walks with my dog or I could stay indoors but either way I am not doing anything worthwhile with my time. There is no purpose of me being around at all. I am starting to run out of things to stay to others because my own words and ideas feel unimportant that I can not bare to talk. I do not want to die because I am in pain, but just because I am so unbearably bored of life.Because of quarantine, I have not eaten as much as usual. Mostly just because I am not at school with friends anymore so I do not have to worry about someone asking me why I do not eat. I also just do not like the food at home. I am not spoiled, but with depression I ALREADY do not want to eat, but I am even less likely to eat if the food is something I dislike. Every now and then I have these phases where I just seriously do not want to eat anything. Nothing related to an ED necessarily, but I am just too depressed to bother to get up and eat. I would rather go through the headaches and stomach pains then just make myself some food.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, yesterday I also weighed myself. I was kind of curious as to what my weight was, because honestly I felt like I had gained weight more than anything with all the junk I had been eating the rare times I did eat. I had lost weight, and I weighed myself again today after not eating anything and I weighed 2 pounds less than yesterday (I know it is not actual weight, just not having any water in my body). I only weigh myself when I want to lose weight (which, considering I am already underweight is not a very good thing). It starts small, unconsciously weighing myself and then next thing you know I am googling the quickest way to lose weight or browsing on pro-ana Tumblr pages.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt is currently 9:30 PM, my mom called me into her room to ask whether I was going to make me something to eat. I have not eaten all day, so you would think she would be happy with me eating something... A week ago I recall her saying \"Well, at least you are eating\" when I told her about the sliders I made. I was NOT making something to eat, all I did was take some fries (LITERALLY only 5 of them) made earlier today by someone in the house out of the fridge. I did not even bother to heat up the fries because she would hear the microwave and get pissed off. Whenever I eat at night (for me, 8-10 is a normal time for me to eat), she tells me I am going to get \"big and fat\" for eating at night. She thinks anything after 5 is too late to eat. I know I am not going to, and I know I am not fat, but her words are like a little fucking depression cloud where you know it is not true but for some reason you still feel bad. I had eaten one fry before she had talked to me. After she talked to me, I went back into my room, was about to eat another fry, and then stopped myself and just cried. I do not even know why. I just cried.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nshe is been doing this since I was a child and I am so fucking sick of it. I remember being 7 and waking up to make a PB&J sandwich (I have been underweight and struggling to eat my whole life)... It was maybe 11 PM, and she told me I would get fat for eating at night. It was a PB&J sandwich and I was 7, who says that to a kid? Do you know how much I weighed when I was 7? Less than 40 pounds. A normal 5 year old weighs 40 pounds and I did not even hit 40 until I was 10 and well into my first year of puberty. I am so tired of her projecting her insecurities on me. she is overweight, not me. she would rather have me go a day without eating than to eat at 9 PM and that is fucking insane.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI want to get up and go eat, just to spite her. But I feel too bad and insecure to do so. I want to eat the 4 fries still sitting next to me, but I cry any time I even think about it. I had a little impulse to go download Tumblr again and browse the pro-ana shit a few minutes ago. Usually I do not think about what or if I am going to eat the next day or not, I do not plan it. But I genuinely do not even know if I am going to want to eat tomorrow either. Part of me wants to start intentionally not eating again. I know it is bad, but I just can not get the thoughts out of my head.I do not hear it mentioned much in this sub but chasing a euphoria is the only thing that brings me joy these days. I am like a junkie trash can. My drug of choice is anything that I can get in my needle. I have tried to get sober lots of times but life is painfully boring.I thought this was just me, but I just saw another post with a similar opinion, so I thought I would share. I do not want help. I do not want to cure my depression. I do not want to get better because I feel like I need my depression. Otherwise, if I enjoy life, I will have to live knowing that one day, it will end and I will have to let go of everything I love. And that is my biggest fear. I sometimes scare myself to the point of breakdowns by just thinking about my own mortality for too long. It scares me more than anything. The fact that one day, I just will not exist anymore. And I feel that, if I do not get out of my depression, I will not have anything worth holding onto at the end and it will not be as daunting. it will be easier to leave and I will not be so terrified anymore.I try to be a good person but maybe I am not deep down and that is why the world is punishing me . I just do not want to be here anymore .So I am a a PC Gamer and I bought an XFX Radeon  RX 570 4 GB for my PC and it is been having a lot of problems ever since, From fan rattling noise to major performance problems, And worst of all is that I can not get an RMA as it is used...\\n\\nI have been worrying too much about these problems and I am tired of it, And I am also kinda scared of gaming now as I do not want to find more problems...\\n\\nI also like doing Judo but since there is home quarantine I can not go anywhere...\\n\\nSo what do you advice me to do? I am tired of this, Any advice would be appreciated.I cannot remember a time when I was not depressed. Not even childhood. When I was a kid, I used to scratch my face until it bled because I thought that my freckles were ugly and the reason I had so few friends, and maybe if I scratched hard enough they would disappear. By first grade, I was in and out of therapist and psychiatrist offices. When they asked me what was wrong, I would usually say something to the effect of \"I am the worst person ever and I do not deserve happiness\". I was once even suspended from elementary school cuz I got in trouble with the teacher for throwing a pencil at a student during a test (on a side note, the teacher yelled at me cuz I \"could have poked his eye out\", which is real fucking stupid since there were folders up so I literally just hit his folder and not him; I think the teacher just hated me), and on the walk down to the principal\\'s office, I banged my chest until my the teacher constrained my arms because I wanted my heart to stop. The principal would not allow me back in school until I received a psychiatric evaluation. I think back on those childhood memories, and then I look at my life now, and I think that maybe there is just no end to this feeling. \\n\\n  \\nI have been thinking a lot recently about how maybe I am just like this. Like, I am just depressed and that is the way it is always going to be. No meds, psychiatrists, hospital visits, or people are going to change that. I do not want to waste ten, twenty, thirty, or however many years tricking myself into believing that this despair will just end.Right now I have been dealing with the fear of losing my parents and knowing someday they will die.Today is my birthday, but i honestly hate my birthday and the holidays because of how my family is. My family can not be in a room together without all of us fighting and by the end of it someone is crying (either me or my mom). I remember 1 year where no one remembered except from my mom, not even my dad remembered but with how he is it did not surprise me. i Just feel horrible today because i also feel like I have accomplished so little in my life because of my depression. I see people posting all their achievements and how they are transferring to the school of their dreams, but with me it is a struggle to even get out of bed. When i try telling people about this they think I am just making excuses or some of them even say, \"that is life.\"  I work with what i have but it just feels like it is never enough. When my depression takes over I am in my bed in the dark crying and feeling worthless then when i go online i see everyone doing so many great things, even the people who bullied me in high school are living their best lives which makes me feel even worse. I wish things were different but i just feel so stuck. Right now I am just waiting for the big family fight that is going to happen once dinner is ready.For some background I am 16 and off and on my whole life i have felt empty and i feel even worse now because i had an amazing year probably the best id ever had i became more confident i got a into a few relationships and i moved into a new school but managed to make new friends not nearly as many as i had before but i did not care about that but since about February i just have not been the same i thought it was over when my family and i went to disney world but after a few weeks i was back to where i am now nothing that i thought was interesting makes me happy anymore no games i play entertain me anymore even though a few months ago it was the only thing i played when but i kinda screwed myself on the social front in the way of getting support because none of my friends know I am like this because i always joke around laugh even if i am completely empty i have let a few things through to the girls I have dated but i never have the time to tell them everything i want to cry i honestly do i used to all the time but i literally can not i have tried everything that used to make me cry but i can not get the emotional release that is supposed to come with it so i just sit here empty and sad like i should be crying unable to socially isolated literally and figuratively and now bored because nothing entertains me(19m) I have been feeling increasingly terrible. more and more each day. I will not lie I feel alone. I rejoined reddit because I feel like I do not belong anywhere. I have been struggling financially for a while. mostly because I am trying to become a musician. my first friend group in college kicked me out because I was \"mentally unstable\" the people who did not agree with that decision were forced to stop hanging out with me. I fucking hate my life. I almost did not get through this year, but I started to play music from my windowsill. that was my only form of expression to feel better, but now, since corona, I do not have that medium. My whole family is pressure to me. they either expect me to succeed or want me to change my life plans. everyone from my old high school hates me or expects me to succeed. that kind of pressure makes me self conscious and then I breakdown. my first friend group in high school had a girl that I really enjoyed talking to. she was a really cool gal. she killed herself my freshman year. I do not know if that still causes me to feel so terrible. It was so long ago. one of the people from the college friend group introduced me to car seat headrest. I have been listening to them a lot recently. I know it is cringe, but sometimes I turn the volume up just so I can cry/scream. I hope I can impact someone like that someday. I will continue to overwork myself and ignore my problems, while college destroys me. I just thought that trying to put words to my feelings was a good idea.I‘m a massive fucking waste of life. Everything would have been so much easier if I had never existed. But it is too late at this point. I am now trapped in this shitty lifetime because I am too fucking scared of dying to off myself.\\nI have come to the conclusion that living is a temporary state and I might as well just wait it out. If only to find out what happens at the end, to see if it was worth it after all. it is so painful but my own mortality freaks me out so much that I can never bring myself to go through with it.\\nI have tried before, with a few different methods, only to spiral, at the last minute, and pussy out all over again. I guess I am stuck between the same shitty rock and hard place as a lot of people. The ‘hate living, fear dying’ dilemma.\\nI have been told so many times that suicide is the most selfish act. I get that. I do not want to hurt the few people still close to me. I also feel like I have wasted all the time, money, and energy that my parents put into raising me and it was all for nothing. I am a failed attempt. But I can not change, as much as I want to and as much as I have tried. I just do not have the will anymore. I am drained of motivation and reasons to try to improve myself.\\nI have picked up some pretty bad habits in my life; typical smoking, drinking, self-harm stuff. I think I am challenging myself to see how much hurt and abuse I can inflict before I cave and finally just fucking die. But in the meantime I guess I will hang around and watch this shit show for a little while longer.I just got a reddit today so I could maybe talk to people that relate to me. So I have struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I am 26 years old and started smoking weed back in high school. A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome triggered by weed. it is just not worth getting sick over anymore. Not trying to be dramatic but weed sort of filled that void in my life, or at least distracted me long enough but also I think it kind of made me worse in the long run. I do not drink. Does anyone have any healthy coping mechanisms to suggest for depression and anxiety? This has been an ongoing battle for me.This is going to be my thrid post on here and honestly it kinda helps just to able to get it out. I do not feel any emotions all too often and lately is been bleeding into my work and I started getting asked if I was okay, and I lied and said I was fine, for context this is the kind of lady who is very high energy in the work place and when she talks she wants someone to respond, which with how I have been I am starting to zone out with headphones in playing music and I am now constantly asking people to repeat them selves because I just do not pay attention to anything. But back to my point is today I found my self at times being really fake to avoid being asked if I was okay again.... yea so that is it, I am going to assume that I am not getting better but I am just taking everything day by dayI am not really sure how to go about this post but I am feeling rough as hell today. I just want to cry all the time or hit something really hard. Everything is so damn bothersome today too. Every day I get like this it gets worse, I feel worse. I could not even tell you what is going on because I do not really know. Just the smallest of shit. I am so unhappy.I was thinking the things that made me real depressed in my teen years now do not bother me. Then my 20s depression was also different. \\n\\nit is like there is always new things to make you miserable.I can not look people directly in the eye no matter who it is.\\nI make eye contact then I start fluttering, and then I redirect myself.\\nit is really fckn annoying because I am self aware of it after the fact, and when I do it.\\nI know why I do this. it is because of everything I had to go through growing up but damn FUCK\\nI need to get it out on here idc man \\nIf I talk to myself or whatever biipolar 1, adhd, anxiety, panic.. can not go to school, have a career, make money... no friends but one who is mean to me. my parents are all i have in this world and i love them, they are really old.. i seem to hate everyone. everyone. i am worried all the time. 2 suicide attempts, ended up on dialysis for a few days. i am relatively smart and clever, stylish but no one accepts me. oddball. financial problems till i die probably in a homeless shelter. my whole life has been pain,  past of bulima, cutting, raped. WHY AM I ALIVEI am the ember of an old bonfire underneath a new one. I am surrounded by new logs and oh, how bright they are burning. Nothing interests me more than the logs and how they are structured above me, supporting each other.\\n\\nEvery time I look at a mirror, I either look away in disgust or stare into my own eyes in attempt to find some semblance of a person...but I stare at myself the same way I stare out a window at nothing particular.\\n\\nSometimes I think if these lyrics from the song \"Drag\" by the band Low.\\n\\n\"I am sorry but I can not hold on\\nIt works much better if I let it drag me around\\n\\nI am sorry if I am losing ground\\nIt works much better if I let it drag me around\"\\n\\nI think the lyrics mean that life\\'s much easier and comfortable with no discipline of the mind...just letting your negative feelings drag you around. I have struggled with my mental health for more than a decade. I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I will feel fine for a good while, and then it will hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I could not even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I am simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I do not know if I am ever going to return to college. I am still in debt for this class too. I am living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan. I am grateful to have it. I do not know what kind of life awaits me. I am 23, and time just seems to zoom by. I do not know if I can handle a job. I am very socially anxious, very self concious and self hating, and when the depressive episode hits, I am 100% useless for an extended period of time. I am good at art... drawing, writing... I am even working on game design. I wrote a novella late last year and sold it on amazon but did not make much, I did not have much for marketing. I guess I am just going to persue a commission based income with art and other creative things I could possibly come up with... Etsy maybe? I do not know... All I know is that I feel sad, and disappointed. Guilty as well. Always very guilty. But I did learn that the traditional route of college, and standard job just is not going to work for me. I really do not want to have to be on SSI forever, but a good start may just be honing my craft and selling my services online. If you have read this, thank you. I do not really know anyone I can talk to right now. I just needed to tell somebody.Anything to celebrate makes no sense anymore, the Christmas just do not feel like before and it makes me super anxious about everything. Then the new year\\'s eve was seeing everyone going on parties and I was just home hanging out by myself crying over the year. And now the Easter, my mom wanted to celebrate it but I did not want it at all and it made her cry cuz she did put work in it.Trigger warning possible\\n\\nI have had depression in some amount my whole life. Recently I have had a breakup and some triggers bring up my past. I have had a rough few weeks. Anyways I just tied a noose because I had some extra rope lying around (suspicious I know but I was just messing around) I tightened it around my neck to send to a friend. I was going to make a joke, \"like my new tie?\" \\n\\nThe strange thing is it felt so good to tighten around my neck. I felt the world slow down and my heart started beating faster. I could feel my vision going fuzzy. I took it off after a few seconds but now I just want to do it more. I realized how easy it would be to kill myself and end all of the complicated BS I deal with. Death is so easy and simple. \\n\\nI am not going to go through with it so do not worry about that. I know I will get better as I always do but right now I do not know how to explain what I am feeling. I feel like cutting or choking myself or something. I will not do that because I know it will haunt me for my whole life but it would feel so good. Anyone have ideas on how to cope? I will probably end up over eatingI have a shitty family situation and I have no time for me literally I have to be an aunt/nanny and a student 100% and when I want time for me oh no it to damn late then when I want to go out they will not let me, I have no friends I mean I have but they do not talk to me often and I know I should talk to them but my depression tells me I am just a bother and uhh I feel I want to drop out and idk wish I could die but I can notI would wager that I suffer from dysthymia from early childhood, but due to the nature of the disorder as it is hard to diagnose I am only being seriously treated for around 5 years. I am 25.  \\nAs I am descending into another episode of double depression, I was wondering if anyone can share an experience of overcoming such disorder. I feel as if I am locked into a cycle: I am fighting my way out, and for a while it seems like the medication have helped me stabilize, but I just dive down again.\\n\\nReturning with less and less strength each time, with a lower and lower starting point it seems. I really hope I make it through this one, But honestly I am both exhausted and hopeless. If you are willing to share, I would be glad to hear how you broke the cycle, or how are you still going through it.\\n\\nTo quote one of my favorite songs: \" I am furthest from the sun, closest to roots of the tree.  \\nyou are not the only one under shade suffering. \"\\n\\nThank you.Quarantine is really fucking with my mental health and being in the house all day with no social interaction is killing me. I can not stand myself anymore.I have been WFH and forced to live with a parent who believes they are going to die from this, between my uncontrollable OCD, them yelling at me for struggling to be able to run some errands and my job while they are around, not going outside, the stress of my job and the hopelessness; I snapped. My parent made the first move. She slammed the door in my face. In anger, I elbowed it back. However, my elbow was too sharp and made a dent. Neither one of us knows what to do anymore and we are both telling each other that we are going to kill ourselves. I do not how much longer I can keep doing this job, I do not know how much longer before I take a bottle of Advil, lock the door and go to bed.Hi, first post here. \\n\\nMy ex-boyfriend broke my heart on Friday and I have been in a really intense depressive episode since. I just feel incredibly numb or overwhelmingly sad. I have not been able to eat since I had a bowl of yogurt Friday morning. I know that it is unhealthy for me to go this long without eating, but I have been feeling nauseous every day all day since he ended it. I can not even stomach the thought of eating. Plus with the quarantine, no car, and no family or friends around me it is rather restrictive for what I can and cannot do. \\n\\nAny advice or help is appreciatedSo sick of just “getting through” my day’s. I want to feel accomplished, which I do not even if I manage to keep the house decently clean and keep my daughter happy. I wake up feeling blah and go to bed feeling the same.Like I have been trying like hell to finalize this place to live for the last month. I was going to move in with my girlfriend as we were getting back together. Except she left me last week. \\n\\nNow I get news today I got the place but who gives a fuck? Where were you last week when the stress of everything took it is tole and ruined the relationship?I do not know what happened, but this wave of sadness just hit me a few hours ago. I was standing in my kitchen, reheating my dinner and \"I would be better off just killing myself\" ran through my head for the first time I can remember in a long time and it made me so sad. I forgot what this feeling was like and I hate that I am feeling it.\\n\\nI have been bad about taking my meds recently, I am graduating college into a crazy recession, it is taken me 7 years! To get my bachelor\\'s and now I do not even get to walk at commencement. I am scared i will not get a job once I graduate and then I will not be able to afford therapy and insurance and my medication and the roof over my head and maybe it is all just cumulating because I have a paper due tomorrow that I can not even push myself to write and maybe if I was better, more committed, not such a loser then I could do all these things. I feel like a fraud sometimes.\\n\\nAnd I know people are dying and I should not be thinking thoughts like this and people have it way worse than I do rn.\\n\\n Any tips to get through the night? I know this feeling will go away but that does not help right now.I constantly debate whether social media is good or bad for my mental health. \\n\\nPart of me thinks that it is toxic and just leads to me feeling worse about myself by comparison, but another part of me feels like if I delete everything then I am just feeding into the social isolation of depression and isolating myself from my friends.\\n\\nI have tried periods without it, recently a period of 6 months, but I always end up coming back to it and when I do I feel even more out of touch and out of the loop with my friends. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any insight/experience?I have struggled with depression on and off since I was in middle school, I am 31 now.  It seems to come and go in waves and sometimes I will be super depressed for months, then things will be better out of nowhere.  I got diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a little over a year ago and have been on medications. I am not very good at taking them though and have gone periods of time not on them. Why do I do this? Also I feel better when I am around people and out of the house, but even before all this crap that is going on now, there would be times where I would avoid everyone and get depressed. I have been in the mental hospital twice and I am scared I will end up back in there again if i can not figure this crap out and stop self sabotaging.I have been questioning if I actually have MDD for a very long time because my mood constantly changes (like a bipolar person). I could be suicidal one week and fine the next week. The cycle repeats continuously. I do not think I actually had a manic episode though. During the times when I am not depressed, I get really anxious. When I am anxious, it is very hard for me to sleep and have more energy but I do not think that is mania because it is also a symptom of anxiety. A year ago, I suspected that I had bipolar and my psychiatrist told me that it does not sound like bipolar to her and convinced me that it is MDD. She has been medicating me on antidepressants for years which are not even that affective. So yeah, I am not certain of my diagnosis and thinking of getting a second opinion.HELP\\n\\nI am turning 13 soon and I am not ready at all. today I broke my record and had 3 mental breakdowns in one day today and I constantly feel like I could collapse at any moment I am not ready for this honestly I just feel like a waste of space and I spent the whole day pacing from my open window and considering jumping out to my bed or trying to forget that I am turning 13. I still accidentally say I am 9 sometimes when I introduce myself and do not feel ready or mature enough or whatever to be turning 13.I have already been sorta diagnosed with depression (it is complicated and I constantly have doubts that I am faking it but fakers do not cut and consider suicide so AAA)  without oversharing more that I already have I am completely lost  and somebody please helpI am tired of this. 12 years of misery. After being skeptical of starting antidepressants again after getting off them a few months ago, I am starting a new medication. I am hoping that it will because me to actually go through with killing myself, because I hear that some antidepressants can because one to be suicidal. Maybe this is the push I needI have been disabled for a little over five years. In that time I have hardly left my house because I have no money. When I first stopped working people kept telling me how \\'lucky\\' I was to stay home. But this quarantine is exactly what my life has been like for 5 years. No chance to go out, nobody coming to visit. Just quiet loneliness. Not so \\'lucky\\' now, am I? Real fun being trapped in your house all the time, eh? WHAT A FUCKING VACATION. \\n\\nSuck it up people. You only have to last a month or two. This is the rest of my life.\\n\\nEdit: words.there is probably something utterly wrong with me but the thought of living my life sucks. I am trying to maintain positivity but it is hard. You have to work to get money, and jobs suck. I personally have no interests in anything and the thought of having to talk to people and have fake conversations just to get by in that career. Idk my life is just so unentertaining and I am wondering if other people feel this way too or if it is just me.\\n\\nI did not focus on grammar or anything so do not judge.I have been holding everything in for so long and I just want to explode and let all of it out. I always had anger issues when I was younger and would lash out immaturely and break things. As I have gotten older I have tried hard to change into a much more cool headed and calm person. Which I feel like I have done successfully to some degree. However I feel that recently I have been having anger issues again yet it takes everything to keep it all in. I still try to portray myself as a calm person but I am always so irritable and angry. What am I supposed to do? I am enraged most of the day yet it takes all of my energy to keep it all hidden and not let it out. Listening to music helps me but at what point do I get to feel things again besides anger. I can not cry even if I want to. I genuinely can not see how death is not the answer to all my problems. It checks all of the boxes.Was going to try and start a family.  \\nI had hope.  I had the desire to keep going.\\nNow probably will not have a job.\\nI am furloughed.  Who cares; everyone else is.\\nFuck the economy.  Fuck my job.  Fuck my life.  Fuck it all. \\nWhy struggle anymore.Basically what the title said but even if i said no they would tell me to and then i would feel pressured to watch with them and i hate it because i can not say anything back. So i am watching a tv show till 11:30 against my will and no way to get out of it because it is 2 v 1.Turns out she is starting to think I am a lost because. She says it seems like I am not putting in enough effort to feel better. I lost 3 jobs, crashed my car, tried to off myself, and had my family tell me they do not want me around them anymore. All of this in under 2 months. Bills are piling up and I am terrified I am going to get evicted and no jobs are getting back to me. Am I crazy for wondering how exactly I am supposed to feel better amongst all this bullshit? It seems like my life is an endless stream of unending chaos. Now even the people who are literally paid to give a shit about me are saying they do not want to deal with me anymore. I am just so tired of it all. I want everything to stop. I just want out of my head for a few minutes. I can not even buy drugs to try and cope with this shit ( I know it is a bad way to cope. I do not care anymore ). I got scammed by a dealer and my reliable dealer moved away. I just want one thing to go my way. I am starting to think it is impossible for me to win anything. there is no small victories anymore. I am so tired.I have  been thinking about committing suicide for a long time. The one thing  that is always stopped me from taking a kitchen knife and slicing myself  open, and watching the blood spurt out like a *Kill Bill* film, is knowing what people would think of me. My family and friends would know I could not hack it and was a disappointment.\\n\\nBut now, Covid-19 has come on the scene.\\n\\nDying  from coronavirus is a blameless death. No-one can call you a failure  for catching it, it is a virus that strikes the poor and rich, the Tom  Hanks and the Baldricks of the world alike. And compared to suicide, the  loneliest of deaths, dying from Covid-19 is a merciful, beautiful  death.\\n\\nCompare with dying because I  deliberately overdosed on my antidepressants: and being found four  weeks later by the custodian crowbarring my door open because the  neighbours complained of a mysterious overpowering stench caused by my  badly decomposing corpse (the place where I lay leaving a dark stain on  the carpet that no amount of scrubbing can remove, and which the tenants  that moved in after me do their best to try to ignore).\\n\\nMeanwhile,  with Covid-19, I would be surrounded by doting doctors and nurses fussing  over me, applying balms and soothing salves to my skin. My mother and  father would Zoom in to cry over me and call me a poor thing as I drew  my last breaths on a ventilator, and ascend to heaven under the angelic,  white light of fluorescent hospital filaments.\\n\\nWhere  I live, New Zealand, is one of the few states not majorly affected by  coronavirus (we have 9 deaths so far). With so few deaths, each person  that passes away gets a full spread on the newspapers and wall-to-wall  coverage on the TV for a week about their life story and interviews with  their grieving relatives. My death, if it was by Covid-19, would be  remembered, and my life would have mattered. As a young lad in my 20s,  my death would be used to save lives. I would be used by the media as a  wake-up call to young people that even they can die from this silly flu,  and that they should stay at home. Then, many years hence, I would be  remembered as one of the honored martyrs that sacrificed their lives to  Covid-19. Every year, in April, there would be a nationwide memorial  service where the names of all those that died of coronavirus would be  read out, and fresh lilies and white doves released by my gravesite.\\n\\nCovid-19: could anyone wish for a more beautiful death?\\n\\nPlease,  if there is a higher power on this Earth. I entreat you. I pray to you.  Please let me contract Covid-19 and die from it, so I do not need to  commit suicide and die a shameful, sinful, solitary, lonely death.Therapy is such bullshit. I have a hard time believing it substantially helps anyone beyond just having a potentially caring person to talk to. I get so frustrated when people tell others to “get help” or “seek therapy” like it is a panacea that will work wonders if only you try hard enough. Been there, done that. It will not make me physically healthy again, will not fix my fucked looks, and will not make me more popular. A big fuck you to the disingenuous “get help” crowd.I have felt the worst pain and shock a human can endure without dying (though I tried). Once you have been to that depth, everything else is nothing. \\n\\nit is a blessing in a way. Nothing hurts anymore. But nothing makes me happy either. \\n\\nI am all on my own. My family has given up on me they quit checking up. My friends think I am fine so they quit checking up. \\n\\nIt is what it is. \\n\\nWe were together 5 years. He was riding our motorcycle. I was driving behind him. I went into shock after seeing his fat and bones and muscles exposed. did not say my goodbyes, could barely breathe. Surgeon said he held on for an hour. \\n\\nHe used to hit me when he was mad. He cheated on me. we would had a fight right before it happened. I would been pregnant two weeks prior. \\n\\nI literally cannot focus on anything anymore. My family and friends are all anti therapy and anti meds so I have been trying not to go. They tell me not to then they leave me alone. I am always in a dense fog on my own here. I cannot remember the feeling of joy. Nor the feeling of sadness. I just exist, pretending to have emotions so people think I am ok and so I do not make them uncomfortable. \\n\\nIt is what it is.I just feel worse, because I can not react to it properly. I start analyzing my consciousness, and I freak out, thinking I am crazy - because of my anhedonia and damaged dopamine receptors. I feel so emotionless that I feel delusional, because I am not able to match my thoughts with any emotions. I feel so emotionless that sometimes I feel like I am going speechless; not like I do not know what to say but like literally speechless, my mind gets out of control and I feel like going completely silent. I feel so emotionless, so unconnected to my body and to my soul. When I look at this empty life I feel like I am in nightmare, but then I pretend I am okay so good that I can even fool myself it is okay. Nothings connected. I am so out of touch with my memories. it is just now and random thoughts I can think of, nothing is sorted in any way. Sometimes I get better days, when I wake up in a brave mood, ready to cop with it. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up, and the cycle starts again. I do not know what to expect. It feels like some part of me gave up on me and I can not continue without it. I do not know what is real. I do not know what is faith. I do not know nothing but fear. I feel like a ghost haunted by ghosts that tease me with all of this experience, not pushing to the point where I am really delusional or hear voices or whatever\\'s the maximum level of fucked up mentality, but they tease me just enough to become more crazy and crazy with each day. I just can not feel anything but a creepy peace. I can not remember emotions. I can not imagine a happy place. Feels like I achieved everything. Or like I have achieved nothing, nothing that truly matters. I do not know if I am getting better. I do not know if I am getting worse. Recently it got to that point where I absolutely lost control of my mind and where it wanders. I am so so empty and no medication can truly help it, I believe; no therapy either - I already told the most important people in my life and it did not give me a relief. Being honest used to be a safe spot, but I played with lies and being honest my whole life so much that I lost the difference between good and evil. I could manipulate every situation to work in my favor. Now I can not be real. But should I blame myself? My shitty childhood and early teenage life created this coping mechanism, not me. It used to be a defense from the cruel world, now I am consumed by it. Feels like I can no longer escape. I wish I could sleep happily again...i feel so incredibly alone.\\nas soon as it was announced that we were going to be quarantined my heart broke. i was finally getting better things seemed to be getting better. i hate my life at home and always will. and everything’s getting worse. and to top it, i feel so alone. i feel like i have no one. no one seems to be talking to em so during the day i sit and do nothing. i can feel myself falling back into old habits. and I am literally not strong enough for it to happen again. i can not do it.I am not sure if this falls under the category of depression. But does anyone else feel undeserving of good things? Like when good things start happening I always feel like what did I do to deserve this? Why me and when is it going to go bad to not being this good?  I do not think I am a bad person or anything, I have my faults like everyone else but I feel guilty and undeserving of good things happening to me and I do not know why.Since I can remember feeling depressed, I have struggled with wishing I was somewhere else. Unable to appreciate the now, always assuming there is more to life and never able to accept things the way they are. I think back to the perfectly trimmed memories I have of days before I felt this way and I disregard any notion of nostalgia and assume that in those moments, I felt as happy as those memories seem. I am always chasing that impossible feeling of peace and satisfaction and it often comes in the form of flashbulb visions\\n\\nI can be thinking about or doing whatever, and a random flash of an unknown setting will commandeer my mind for a second. There are some that reoccur and some that are fresh every time. Sometimes its just a staircase of a home that is incandescently lit, sometimes its a night at home in an apartment I have never seen. Just like a dream, there can be context for the vision. This comes in the form of details about my life at the time. It could be 20 years form now with a family that I love. Whatever it is, it is random and and torturous. Its like a fishing line with bait that is constantly held above my head, taunting me for my inability to attain satisfaction. I do not know what these are trying to tell me but they are a constant reminder that I am not satisfied with what I have. \\n\\nI often get lost in the fleeting image that has been left behind after it happens. I struggle with a near obsession with escapism in my lower moods and these visions walk hand in hand with that. I spiral into a jealousy for a dream that is impossible and with every jealous mood I grow farther from accepting reality as it is, allowing me to finally be happy or at peace.\\n\\nDoes anyone else feel similar or experience anything of the sort? I was just writing this to get my thoughts into words but I would appreciate some discussion. I feel very alone in this.When I was finishing high school I had a very strange last semester, I got dumped right before my exams, met the love of my life (were still together) a week later after that person dumped me, anyway while we got together somebody (some random computer dude who also helped ruin my life, was not someone from my school but was someone from Around the world) was very jealous of the fact I would not date them and proceeded to edit and released fake nudes of me from my accounts because I would not date said person. (There was one video where it was me topless but that was it that was real) From there everything sort of fell apart and that is when all the bullying began in my school. Many people told me how disgusting of a person I was how I have no respect etc. I thought I at least had my little group of friends... no these group of people called me the worst names commented on my weight, commented on my annoyance, my breath apparently stank like vagina and Incredibly sexist slurs. When I found out about the comments I confronted them and they told me to leave the group.. from\\nThere I heard that they had a party for my departure and were waiting to kill myself so they can party because of the fact I was dead, after that I no longer talk to anyone and I think that is why I hate myself as much as I do and my boyfriend I am with now is literally the only reason I am still alive.. this is just the main part many little things happened that made the situation worse.\\n\\nI will also add I have had issues for years that we are never clearly diagnosed, I am on Zoloft for depression and anxiety for about 5 years now. I also can not do anything without feeling like I am. Not good enough and I can not be around people whatsoever without getting incredibly nervous around them.\\n\\nThis happened 2 years ago but I still have insanely massive issues from this massive trust problems, I still feel suicidal and I hate myself profusely I saw the main girl and guy who bullied me on Instagram being happy and I honestly felt so sick I just want them both to die a painful death. I have also considered dumping my amazing boyfriend just because of how suicidal I have been and I honestly feel as if I may act upon it.. I do not want to drag him down with me... Any suggestions?\\n\\nI posted almost the same thing on another thread, if not allowed please removeMy life is constantly going to shit and I feel lonely, I have constantly made jokes about killing my self since 8th grade. At the beginning they were just jokes but soon it started becoming a reality.\\n\\nI have a very shirt family that does not really support me, but even with all of those problems I still try to put my best effort in things. I have the highest average of all the kids in my grade, I am the president of my class and I always try to be the best.\\n\\nThe thing is, no person at home really values my effort  and it is really frustrating. I will come home with straight A’s but my dad and mom will not even care. My dad is barely at home and when he is he just scolds me and beats me, calling me useless, idiot and a variety of other insults. \\n\\nI have wanted to kill myself for the longest time, but teachers, friends and people from other schools tell my I have a bright future ahead of me, that I could be the best engineer, architect, game designer, etc.\\n\\nThese complements are the only things keeping me alive, I just dream of the day I will be able to get out of my house and live on my own, possibly with someone that actually cares for me. But until then, every time I come home it is hell, and now with covid-19 it is even worse...This world is far less tolerant because people are a much more common resource, making mistakes makes you easily expendable, which makes you vulnerable, which brings on anxiety. I am not perfect, I will always be ME, and this world is not very accommodating to those that do not have a choice about their disposition, REGARDLESS of how hard they work.Before the UK \\'lockdown\\', I was living at my BFs with his mum during the week and going home at the weekends, slowly moving to being at his fully. I stayed at my parents over a long weekend so my mum could use my car for work while hers was being repaired when the news came in that we could not go anywhere and all that jazz. I decided to stay at my parents so she could continue to use my car if she needed. Cut to today, nearly a month later, and I am a mental mess. I have seen my BF once, when he picked some stuff up for us from the supermarket (my mum started showing minor symptoms) but other than that, I have not seen him in a month. I miss having him close, talking on the phone is not enough. I need to be held only the way he does. Being at my parents is overwhelming me, and I took for granted just how much better I was mentally when I was at my BFsMy depression has been really bad lately. I had an argument with my partner and he would not let up for several hours, eventually I could not take it and hit myself really hard on my chest and in my face, enough to because bruising and swelling. I did not do this in front of him.\\n\\nI feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself for this. I do not know what to think about it.So depressed I want to set myself on fire as a protest or demonstration.\\n\\nOr lay down in a remote wooded region until I die from dehydration.\\n\\n\\nI am so depressed I can not live anymore.\\n\\n\\nPlease someone put me out of my misery.\\n\\nWill you help me?I am just tired.  Of every single damn thing.\\n\\nOf my family, for which I am just a caretaker for my grandma and uncle (her son) for the rest of my fucking life, because nobody else cares about them, and partially I cannot blame them; grandma is not a nicest person to be around most of the time, let us put it this way, and I am always around since i live with her.\\n\\nOf my mother, who has been using me for so many years, just so everything will stay HER way. Telling me to cry when dad came home lately and ask him \"why are you not with me and mommy anymore, we are worried\", or to refuse his plushie bear he gave me on the children\\'s day, just because they were separated. Years later, when I run away from dad and went to live with grandma (that was long ago, when she was not that way she is now), she often told me how she always missed me and my sister, how she know that dad was manipulating me and \"forgives me\" for things I said when I WAS 7 GODDAMN YEARS OLD. how she went on rehab and was hardly drinking anymore, how she loved me and always would be here for me. And now? Anytime I went to visit her she was always drinking her ass off, making excuses as always. Wanted to intimidate me to cancel my plans to leave my city and move out to the other side of the country, saying that \"If i do it, i will not be having a mother anymore\". And honestly, yeah, she is right. I will not. I do not want a mother who cares so little about her fucking daughter that openly tells that \"she does not want to go with me to therapist because she has better things to do and i simulate everything anyway\", and when I tried to open up to her that one goddamn time and told her about my self-harm problems and two suicide attempts, she just shrugged it off and said \"ah, okay, nice\". So, yeah. she is right. I do not have a mother anymore and I honestly do not know if I ever had one.\\n\\nOf my father, who just... did not cared then and does not care now. Who is able to go arm with arm with me on the street and pretend he do not see me, just to avoid conversation. Who has the balls to text me about \"how he misses us\" and \"how everyone is against him\", and then act like he does not know me, my sister, his siblings or his ex wife. But, well, at least he never tried to hide that he do not care.  \\n\\n\\nOf my sister, who is the only person in my whole family that I am actually afraid my death would hurt more than a bit. she is just... too pure for her own good. When I could not hide that I am crying she was trying to make a fucking \"memes\" out of random google images, just to make me laugh. And she was actually only one trying to be with me, understand, even tho she is only fucking 10 and I am, well, a shitty person in general and a lot more shitty older sister. I do not want to push her away, so my death would be less painful for her, but I also do not want her to be hurt in any way, especially not because of me. I do not know what to do.\\n\\nOf my friends, who just.. I am too attached to to just leave them like that. I know that they do not care about me that much, that when I die all it will take for them to forget about me is just a couple weeks, but i care about them. If I am useful to them, if I can help them with their own problems, If i can do anything to make them feel better and have better lives than they have now, I have to fucking do it. Even if that will take years, I want them to be happy. And still... I am so tired of this perspective and my selfishness. That I can not just end it now, that I HAVE TO keep going for them, to help them overcome their own problems, that I have to keep waiting even for years to finally feel good with myself ending all of this and even though I will always be for them just a third wheel, just this weird girl who they can always talk to when their better friends are not around.Of me, not being able to handle everything that is going on.\\n\\nOf my fucking mind not being able to do things properly, care about myself, my future and self-care anymore. Of being too fucked up to even pass my last year of high school. Of not getting over an ended friendship (toxic as fuck, but still) with a girl I can not stop feel something to, even if she had made my mind even bigger mess that it was already, telling me that \"If i want to kill myself that much, then I should do it now, because only thing I deserve is to die alone\", of being unable to hate her, of being too shitty to do anything productive or learn anything useful. Of being always \"not good enough\". Of waiting.\\n\\nI am just really tired, that is all.School is shit and it is cold outside. Why would I want to leave my room?Here is everything wrong with me:\\n\\nI am the loneliest person ever. I feel like nobody cares about me.\\n\\nRelationships: i cannot get a any guy to look at me or admire me. Nobody looks me at me and thinks I am good enough. The love of my life is no longer with me and it hurts so bad I can not take it anymore. I cry everyday after 11 months the heartbreak is tearing me apart. Ever since the breakup I have been fantasizing my own death. Plus the lack of affection and intimacy is driving me insane.\\n\\nMy body: I am skinnier than everyone I meet. It makes me feel abnormal. I do not have curves like other women and it makes me feel embarrassed. \\n\\nI am too socially awkward, I cringe everytime I speak, it is awful I do not know why I can not interact normally and develop close friendships.\\n\\nI am just a mess. So ugly and embarrassing. And I do not deserve to be aliveI have been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression about 5 months ago and i never really understood what they were or what they feel like snd then the anxiety started coming in and i grew accustomed to it but the depression part was always shady bc I have never really felt happy or unhappy always just neutral but here lately i feel like the depression is really kicking in i have been feeling empty and lack of motivation and really un social and very drowsy alot and i feel like i am breaking apart on the inside. Is this what depression is or is this something else please help me understand what i am going through.\\nEdit: i am a 17 year old male who has always struggled with displaying emotion if that is any significant information.I have struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I have talked to many counselors for my school to camp, and once a therapist that came by my school because my school struggles with mental health issues my counselor could not keep up with. Regardless they have all suggested that I get help, be it medication or having a real Therapist, but my mother refuses to get me anything for my depression and anxiety (I am sixteen I can not go over her head). Anytime I bring up that I am struggling with life she says \"be a man about it\" or \"Real men do not cry\". I do not have a father to help with these problems. I do not know how to to tell her without making a scene of myself. I am tired of the pain, I want help so bad but I can not reach out because anytime I do I feel like I am going to get ridiculed for it. What do I do? How do I make her understand?I had managed my depression pretty well in recent years. I am 19, about to be 20, been dealing with it since about 13. Had a really hard first year of university, had somewhat suicidal thoughts on occasion, but had received enough support to know that things would get better with time. I had a great second year, really the first time I was able to fight off my depression for months at a time since I first started struggling with it.\\n\\nThen when coronavirus started to get serious it was like all of my progress and hope was completely undone. I am a very social person, my depression comes from having a lot of anxiety and general hopelessness when things look grim, but I have always felt happiest when having support/living life. Now I am faced every day with staring at my childhood room, reading reports that this is going to go on for 2 years. I only have a limited time to be young and honestly I can barely bear the thought of another month of this, let alone years or this becoming the new normal. I have never had this consistent thoughts of suicide even if this is not the most depressed I have ever been. It just has never seemed this hopeless. If it looked like things would be normal even in a month or so, I think I have learned enough coping skills to manage. But this is the first time in my life where the more I see that the end date is not for months or years, the more I question how I am going to stay sane or alive to see it. I would rather die of the virus than rot like this. I do not want to seem selfish, obviously I do not want others in society to die just because I can not handle this, but it just seemed I had my life together and now I am being faced with the worst circumstances for my mental health that I could ever imagine.\\n\\nSome advice would be appreciated, though I assume many here would be in the same boat.I have been on so many different medications, I have been to therapy. I moved to a different state for a fresh start, I met new friends. All of this should have helped me, but it really never did. No matter what I do, I just feel empty. I do not know if I am ever going to feel better. What else is there even left to try? I feel like my depression used to be better because there was at least the hope that things could change. But now I know it never will.What is wrong with me, why no one likes me?   \\nWhy I am always the different one?   \\nI want to socialize or meet people but everyone lies to me and does not want to meet no matter what...   \\nEven if it is not quarantine I am spending all my free time on the computer alone.   \\nI have no idea what to do.All I have ever wanted in my life was to be something to someone other than my mom and dad and sister\\n\\nI have never had a girl interested in me, and at the age of 28, I feel like a failure to my parents. Every time I walk past them I know they are thinking \"why is he alone?\" \"why does not he have a girlfriend?\" \"When is he going to get married?\"\\n\\nAnd once they are gone, I will lose the only thing in my life that ever cared about me. I do not know what I will do then.\\n\\nHow do I tell them I can not do any of those things? How do I tell them I am going to die alone and a failure, as a man and as a son?I can even talk anymore i can not even function anymore, i know I am going to do it today maybe tomorrow whenever i build uo the courage, i can not take it anymoreI have never told *anybody* this. I have anxiety disorder and bipolar and people do not know by looking at me. I am a pretty blonde with curls and a bubbly personality. But I am *so miserable* inside. I have thought about killing myself multiple times a day since childhood. I grew up in the system and had a pretty shitty childhood but it was no where near as bad as some of the people I grew up with. I had a *few friends* whose parents were brutally murdered in front of them. Or I had friends who were brutally raped as a small child. I mean I had shitty things happen to me but nothing really that bad. So I thought I could not really feel sorry for myself. I have always been the person that jokes and tries to be positive to make situations better. But fuck me, I am in a low spot. I helped so many of my foster brothers and sisters out and now that I need someone, I keep reaching out (which I never do) and I keep being left on read. I know everyone is going through some shit right now but damn. Honestly I am off my meds for financial reasons and really feeling it. Why does the government move so damn slow when they owe you money? \\n\\nSorry for the rant, like I said I am off my meds :(\\n\\nAlso I am not going to do anything drastic, I have 3 kids and my 2 brothers depending on me and I am all they haveHey, at the moment I am on a crossroad of my life.\\nMy dog died last month, my girlfriend and I broke up a week ago and my studies is going down the drain.\\n\\nI am in my examination phase and I can not do anything except for lying in bed, watching YouTube, smoke cigarettes, eat, drink, going to toilet and get fucked up about myself.\\n\\nI did not sleep before 2 am in the past 2 weeks (although I tried medicine) and I can not get concentrated when I am trying to learn for my examinations. If I fail them then the pressure will be even higher. And if I fail the studies then I will be 25 with no vocational training or a job. And I do not even have like a jobidea for me...\\n\\nI am fucked up and I hate myself for not being stronger, for being \"lazy\" and that shit.\\nit is a constant circle of fucking me up more and more.\\n\\nMaybe you have handled situations like this in the past and have advices for me. This would be lovely.\\n\\nThanks. ❤️I really wish I was better at making friends and being able to keep them as my forever friends I know that sounds really corny but damn I really suck at being friends with people because I do not know how to not be anxious and nervous and worried about everything whenever I am around new people also I hate silence makes me feel so anxious and awkward.. It sucks having no friends when you do not even have a family either... I am basically always alone .. and I always feel empty inside. 😔 I crave real life human interaction but I simply do not know how to be friends with anyone because I also have anxiety.. I just wish my brain did not feel like a huge foggy grey cloudTo preface, I am diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety, as well as a couple other things. For a while, I was in therapy, but the woman I was working with dropped me as a client out of the blue and practically fell off the grid. This was pretty hard to deal with to begin with, considering I was already having a hard time with the idea that anyone sees me as worth anything. So for a few months things were quiet and I just went on with life without therapy. Then the coronavirus quarantine started, so even if I found a therapist, we could not meet. Recently I have been having a lot of issues with relationships with friends, family, etc. because the progress I would made in therapy began to really unravel. I realized that I was going to need help, so I started looking into online options. I found one that I thought would be good, went through the questionnaire, and clicked the submit button. At the end it took me to a page that said, \"thanks for taking the time to fill out our questionnaire. Unfortunately, based on the answers given, we feel that online counseling with us is not the best option for you.\" \\n\\nNow I pretty much feel completely destroyed and really invalidated. I have got no one to go to, and it was already really hard for me to try this. I feel totally alone, and even though this is a small thing it destroyed any chances of me feeling confident enough to look for help.I am in the middle of a horrible depressive episode. I cried hysterically and screamed pretty much nonstop for three days and barely slept. Last night things got really, really bad. I finally convinced my husband, son, and ex-husband that I can not do anymore. I have to stop and take care of myself, or I will not be around much longer. I can not do everything for everyone (I have some extremely needy men in my life!). \\n\\nSo I was told to rest and they would take care of everything. Except they are not. they are letting my body rest when it is my MIND that needs a break. They keep coming to me asking for help with computers, video games, what to have for meals, how to make the meals, whether or not they should buy eggs at the store or throw away a flyer for homeowners insurance (we rent an apartment). \\n\\nHow can I communicate to them that I am not capable of all this right now? you would think that the fact that I start crying hysterically, pulling at my hair, and screaming “I can not do this!!!!” when they ask me for help would be a good clue. But they still do not get it. \\n\\nI am in serious, serious trouble. I have not had a depressive episode this bad in years. To top it all off, my husband lost his job and we do not have health insurance. I am trying to take care of myself the only way I know how, but they are making it impossible. \\n\\nWhat can I do?I stated cutting again yesterday. I would stopped for 3 months and then it just happened. it is like an addiction- if you ever go back to it- you can not stop again straight away. Yesterday I had 25 cuts, today I had 83. I am not suicidal, I do not think, but I am too scared to admit my issues. Last time my mum saw my cuts, she told me I was stupid. Told me I was not depressed while I cried and screamed. She told me I was only crying because I would been caught. The only reason she found out is because I told my closest friend- she said I could not keep doing this and told her. She thought she would help me. My mum never does. She threatens to put me in a nutty institute and when she finally promises she will take me to a therapist- she never does. I do not expect her to help anymore. All she did was because more pain, made it easier for me to self harm and allowed my mental state to deteriorate. I do not know how much longer I can do this for. there is one phrase that comes to mind which is, “ I do not want to live, but I am too scared to die.”\\nAt this point it is taboo to use it, but there is no other words for it. I am 14 and probably will not make it to 16like, i would not call it numbness, it is just that i have no strong feelings, towards most things. e.g. when my therapist asked me how i found the session, i did not know what to say because i have no feelings about it - it was just something that happened. and a lot of the time when she asks me things like \"do you want to improve on x?\" i just answer that i do not know (because there is not really anything i want). i also feel this way in most of my friendships; they are my friends and i \"love\" them, but i do not really get attached to or trust anyone. recently I have opened up a little to 2 of my friends, but it was not really about trusting them more, it is just i do not care if they tell people, because I am not scared of losing friends. and i do want close relationships, it just seems like I am unable to connect to anything. everything and everyone just exists, and that is all.\\n\\nedit: just realised i wrote the title wrong, it is meant to be *related to, not towards. oops.I hate those people who always complain about having “no friends” and yet when you text them nothing for day or weeks. that is not all tho because those “no friends” turn out to be ten times the about of friends you have and they know you actually have no friends. Yet they say shit like “same lol” when you say you have no friends.I really miss a certain someone. I felt like just as things really went into lockdown I made a breakthrough with them. Being easily bummed, I am trying to say “I can not wait to see them” as opposed to “Oh god I miss them” or similar.\\n\\nIdk, sometimes it is the little things I have to look for through all of this.I am going to write this on my language because I need it to can communicate my real feelings. \\n\\nÚltimamente he tenido bastantes problemas tanto personales cómo familiares, de hecho ahora mismo escribiendo esto mis padres están discutiendo y sinceramente eso no me afectaría tanto pero agregado a eso he estado teniendo problemas con mi novia por problemas que pasaron hace mucho tiempo pero que siguen teniendo impacto en mí corazón. \\n\\nTal vez no suene cómo mucho pero enserio es algo que me causa demasiada inestabilidad mental y sentir que ninguna de las personas a mi alrededor realmente desean mi compañía o la valoran y me da miedo que eso llegue a escalar a tener pensamientos suicidas.How fucking long will my fucked psyche take to fix itself. I am still a fucking mess after like 2-4 years ( I am not sure how much time has passed ). I am not going anywhere. I like someone who does not like me back. I can not get anything done exept sit and do nothing. Ik really starting to reconsider my options here.Been talking to this girl I have had feelings for for a while and she keeps sending mixed signals plus I am withdrawaling from opiates and benzos so does not help my overthinking... idk what to do i think i love her but i have no clue how she feels about me and I am too scared to straight up ask..Hey.  I want to talk a little about my life.  I am 20 years old.  In early childhood, I lost both parents.  The first 9 years of 11 at school I had practically no friends.  I walked alone, chatted with people from other cities on the Internet.  In the last 2 years of school I have changed.  made many friends, had fun with them.  Everything was the same in the first year and a half of the university.  Then bad things happened in my life.  I got depressed.  (I have a confirmed diagnosis).  For about a year I did not go anywhere except study and shop, rarely went for a walk.  I stopped seeing all my friends in real life.  Over the past half year I went to the party 3 times.  I forced myself to go there because I thought it would help me.  During this time, I began to feel worse every day.  It seems to me that people are looking at me because something is wrong with my face.  Every time I meet a girl I like, thoughts arise in my head that I am a jerk, and should not even think about her.  My mind makes me think that I am not worthy to be part of someone\\'s life.  And I believe in it more and more.  I am not trying to find new hobbies for myself, because I am afraid that others will laugh at me.  But the worst thing is that for a long time, I think about suicide every day.  These thoughts arise completely suddenly.  Sometimes it is enough for me to look at my face in the mirror, and my brain begins to think that such a freak as I am not worthy to even appear in public, and it is better for him to kill himself.  I am very much afraid, because every day these thoughts arise more often, and they are more and more detailed.  The only thing that keeps me here is my relatives.  I am afraid to go completely crazy.  Now I am very lonely, I have not seen friends for many weeks.  All I dream about is a normal life, like everyone else.  But I feel that I will either commit suicide or die because my body weakens every day.  I do not have money for a psychologist, and it is unlikely that they will help me here, but at least I could speak out, and it became a little easier for me.  I have too many mental disorders, but I can not talk about them in more detail, because the text is so very long.  Thanks if you read this.I have very high expectations of myself and I have struggled to fulfil them. I have two, now three athletic careers to look back at that ended in failure just before I reached the goals I had respectively pursued for years with 100% dedication, training 15-20 hours a week.\\n\\nI am over thirty now and my last shot of making it was taken away from me because my partner (non romantic) decided that what I was delivering was not good enough. Our coaches thought it was going well but for her it just was not enough. I trusted her 100% and she revealed from one day to the next that she did not see any future in us working together.\\n\\nInstead of letting me go she kept me around for three months saying that just because she does not see a future does not mean there is not any. That made no sense to me but I got so depressed that I just hoped it would somehow work out.\\n\\nThree months later I finally packed my shit and moved back home. it is so crushing to have somebody you did everything for tell you she accepts that you did everything you could but it just is not enough.\\n\\nInstead of giving me a way to save myself she insisted on explaining why it is me that is not good enough and that is the reason it is not working. None of this \"it is not you, it is me or it is us\" or whatever you say when you try to let somebody down gently. Then I got an email detailing all the shit that is wrong with me. All she wanted was me to validate how she was feeling which was that my best is not enough. How the fuck can she not see how cruel that is?\\n\\nI had just quit my job to pursue this dream full time but that did not matter to her either. She refuses to accept that you have some responsibility for the well being of a partner who depends on you. She sees nothing wrong with how she acted because it was not her intention to hurt me, just an unfortunate side effect. Hitler also had reasons and in his mind good intentions. that is no excuse.\\n\\nShe also said that I made her quit me by getting injured and being low on energy (because of depression I had just started getting treatment for). Maybe rape is the wrong word but I feel brutally abused and while it was going on I was told that it is my fault and shame on me for making her do that.\\n\\nI am usually good at processing breakups but this time I just can not. I got even more severely depressed and I can not get these thoughts out of head. How could she do this to me? Everybody thinks she is nice and a great person. This was my last chance of achieving the greatness I have been dreaming of for 18 years. I have never been this close and now I am left with nothing. My whole identity has evaporated and now I do not know how to fill the void. There is basically no chance to find a new partner at this level so everything I have worked for is fucked.\\n\\nTo me it feels like failure to get a job and live a \"normal life\". it is not who I want to be but I am out of options because somebody took my last option from me. Now I am too old to do what I really wanted to do. Part of me refuses to accept this.\\n\\nWall of text. Fuck everything. There you have it, reddit. I do not want to live anymore,:do not have any friend, been bullied my whole life in every school, and by my own parents. I am so anxious and deeply depressed that I am afraid to go out of my room and I have problems with my memory and learning. I can not fix my life. What is the the least painful way of committing suicide?but it does not matter I have spent a whole year of my life and somehow I still hate myselfi feel empty. there is a massive void inside of i fill with meaningless and harmful distractions. i know others have it too, i just want to know why. why do i lack something it feels like ‘normal’ people have. what the fuck am i missing.It seems drug overdoses never work these days but lmk.Struggling with loneliness for about 17 years now, trying not to be is a battle that I am losing. Hope you found a way out.also, husband free. and i think strongly that that is what i want forever. it is not depression although thinking about my finances does depress me. growing old single, without an awsome career, fucking sucks. i worry alll the time. anybody relate?Life is so unpredictable. I am scared to make life changing choices and to see what the future holds. I do not want to be filled with regret like I am now.Why would anyone lonely(not alone, lonely) who hates himself want to live?I can not believe I tried and tried to give life another chance. So cruel to live like this. It gets worse and worse. \\n\\nI have no one to talk to about this. I can not form proper thoughts, I feel so consumed by it all. \\n\\nI do not want to feel unwanted or unloved anymore. My body is so trashed from previous attempts and my head just can not handle this anymore. \\n\\nAfter my dads birthday tomorrow I have decided I am going back to my uni accommodation and I am going to kill myself. Too many years of not feeling better is too much for anyoneBut you have no control over it and then you just hate yourself for not being able to do something about it. Not the only reason why I have depression but I have found that it is one of the triggers.I am going to be alone foreverDISCLAIMER: I know that self-diagnosing is not the right way to approach this and I am not at all self-diagnosing in the post below. I want to talk to a doctor but with all the COVID-19 stuff going on, it is not possible. I am just reaching out right now for some help and I guess just to get an explanation for what I am feeling.\\n\\nI am a 17 year old female.\\n\\nIn October, my boyfriend fell really badly. His parents were not exactly there for him because they were upset with him about something. He was not my boyfriend at the time, but still my best friend. He fell on his back, broke his leg, had a concussion, sprained his wrist, etc. His back was in so much pain that he needed to be prescribed painkillers. He took oxycodone which helped with the pain a lot but the doctor actually overprescribed doses. He was taking more than he was supposed to without even realizing it. When the doctor did realize, he immediately canceled the next prescription he was supposed to pick up. He then started to experience withdrawal symptoms and they were BAD. At one point, I thought he was going to die. I used to spend hours taping his back, giving him the right medicines, helping him. Anytime that I was not helping him, I was just worrying. I know that what he was going through was horrible for him so I felt selfish ever expressing my feelings or telling anyone how stressed out and worried I was. Every time he told me a different symptom or something he was going through, I would just go to my room and cry and pray silently. I felt like it was selfish for me to worry in front of him. But, all the symptoms he had were things he just got lucky from not dying from. Since then, my attitude towards life significantly changed. He did get better but, he is still not perfect. I became a really negative person after this and basically just told myself that the worst case scenario was going to happen with everything in my life.\\n\\nA while after this, we started dating. It was fine for a while and obviously we did what any teenage couple would (making out etc). But I have very strict parents. One day, they looked through my phone and found out about everything that happened while we were on vacation. They told me having a daughter like me was a mistake, threatened to kick me out, said I would be nothing but a failure in life. My father did not speak to me for a while and it was a really difficult time for me. Despite how traditional my parents were, I had always had a close relationship with them and the stuff that they said to me in this time really really hurt. I am playing down the things they said a lot out of respect for them but they were really really bad. it is something that I think about to this day. My parents have always held me to a high standard but some of the things they told me just put me down even more and increased this negative attitude I have towards life.\\n\\nI went to my gynecologist for irregular periods and she asked me some other questions. I noticed that whenever my period cycle was about to start, I became super sad and detached and just went to a really bad place. I always thought it was PMS so I asked my doctor how to help with it. She asked me to explain some of my symptoms and after some time she said I could be experiencing PMDD (Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder) which is essentially a more heightened form of PMS, but can also mirror symptoms of depression. At this time, I was feeling different. I felt super sad a lot of the time and I really only talked to a couple people. Before this, I was probably the most outgoing and interactive person you would meet. I was friends with everyone, out every weekend, and I also did really well in school. My junior year I got a 35 on the ACT and had a 4.5 GPA. But, once senior year rolled around, I had straight C\\'s and really did not care much about anything. I put all of this off as PMDD and my gynecologist did suggest going on birth control but my mother has always been against it so I did not\\'.\\n\\nIn January, this sadness became increasingly worse. At this point, I really only talked to one person, my boyfriend. I tried to tell him what was going on but the words just could not come out of my mouth because honestly, even I did not know what I was feeling. I just felt stuck and I just felt this lingering sadness and I did not know exactly what it was coming from. One night, I began to feel like the room was spinning and I could not breathe. I started crying and struggling to breathe at the same time. I felt like I could not move almost. This lasted for about 25 minutes and after that I just sat there for a while. I became sadder and sadder the longer that I sat there and eventually I cut myself. If you asked me then, I could not have explained why I did that and even now I can not. It just happened so quickly. I just put a band-aid on it and forgot about it and did not address it.\\n\\nAt this point, every little thing began to worry me. If I got a bad grade I thought colleges would rescind my acceptance. Everytime my mom called me downstairs I thought I was going to get kicked out. Everytime my boyfriend texted me, I thought something had happened and he was gone. Everytime anyone talked to me, I just could not hold a conversation and had no motivation to talk to them. It was senior year. This time last year, I imagined myself partying but here I am stressed about a hundred things that I have no explanation for.\\n\\nThe cutting continued. These episodes were I could not breathe or move did. I just did not address it. I would try and get through it at home and put on a happy face when I talked to people in school. In March, I finally decided to address it. I knew I had to tell someone about it and reach out for help but I just could not. I was so embarrassed and honestly a part of me felt like I was just being overdramatic. I did not know where this sadness was coming from. I constantly yelled at myself saying others have a lot more struggles than I do and I should be thankful. I was telling myself this, yet it still continued.\\n\\nIn March, all my friends began to hate me. They said that I ditched them for some boy and would ignore me every time they saw me. they would talk shit about me to people, they used to flat out talk to each other about things that involved me when I was right there and never let me talk. It hurt me so much because I did not know what to do about it. One friend told me that I had never been there for her and I was a horrible friend that had no presence of mind or empathy for anyone. All this just hurt because before this year she was literally my best friend.\\n\\nIt was really hard for me to open up about this because even I did not know what I was going through. But, one day I got the courage and talked to one of my friends about it and I apologized to her for not being there. All she responded with was, \"Everyone gets sad, you are not the only one. You think I was not sad when I did not place first in track last week? it is always something with you\" and it just hurt me so so much. It had taken me so much to open up to someone and once I did she just put me down. And she discussed what I told her with so many people when all I was trying to do was confide in her and ask for some help. I decided then talking about it would help no one and resorted to cutting myself.\\n\\nAt this point, my boyfriend began to notice that something was wrong. He asked me and one day I just broke down and told him everything. I could barely breathe while talking to him and I began to say the same sentence to him, \"I do not want to be here.\" Because honestly, I did not. I kept telling myself. What was here for me? I am not happy, my friends hate me, my parents will forever be disappointed in me, I did not get into the college my parents wanted. There was nothing keeping me here. I just wanted to be gone and resorted to cutting. Once I told my boyfriend this, he was there for me. He used to stay on call with me for hours talking to me and comforting me. It really helped because after being put down by the girl I used to call my best friend, I just really needed some support. He was there for me every time he sensed something was wrong and I thank him for any improvement that I made. He has been struggling with depression since his injury so I did not exactly know if I should open up to him knowing he had a lot going on that was worse than me.\\n\\nHere I am today. I want to talk to a doctor about all this but I am not sure if its necessary. Am I being dramatic? Is all of this just me overreacting? Or could there actually be something going on? And if so, where could it have stemmed from? I was the happiest person last year and this year something just changed. I do not know what it was and I really just want some outside opinions right now. If you did read all this, thank you so much and any response would be super helpful to me.I (25F) met my narcissistic ex husband (25M) five months before we were married. I know it sounds stupid.. But he was everything I ever wanted... And needed... And I seemed to also be for him.. I had faith.. \\nEverything changed as soon as we got married and he became abusive and cold. Now it is almost nine months since I have been at my parents house... Still waiting for divorce to be over and done with.. But I feel so finished..\\n\\nHe was the LOVE of my LIFE... Abuse and all.. I got married for life.. For a reason... Not just to be thrown away.\\n\\nI cannot get past it.. I cannot find anyone that can measure up to all he was to me... I had been so happy and alive.. I still cannot believe the change... I do not want to believe it... \\n\\nNow I have someone persuing me, and I want to open myself up to it... But all I feel is pain. And memories. And every night I just want to bash my head in to stop thinking so much about this. My new life was supposed to start and now I am just an empty she will of what I was.. I hate that he changed... I hate that I loved him so much.. I hate this stupid stupid life. I do not want to be here. Where I am is not where I am supposed to be and there is nothing I can do about it.. I am drowning. And I am the only one who can feel the water around me. I am done with it all.Sometimes that this pandemic is making me realize is how alone and empty my life is. I had chemo and since have had to be quirintened for going on 6 weeks now and it just has shown me how little impact i make. My Mom, gma , a freind and 2 co workers have been the only ones to contact me to make sure I am okay. I just dropped off the planet and this is it. Its all making me feel so alone.Depression has taken alot from me honestly. I used to draw, write, and play musical instruments all the time but now I can not even pick up a pencil without having a mental breakdown. Drawing and writing used to be a form of self expression back then, it helped me cope with my issues but now the pencil seems heavy. I need to recover my old hobbies and interest but it seems so difficult.I am not sure I have ever said this to anyone other than my abusive ex. I think I have depression, or severe mood changes? Honestly I do not know.\\n\\nI am 10/10 afraid to share my true thoughts and feelings with basically anyone, I am so afraid ofettimf the world know me, I want to have connections with people but everyone has been so shit to me. I have not had a bad life, I played sports in college I am averagely pretty, I have a great job, and I am even going for my master\\'s degree. However I can not help but feel like the world is against me, or that I am invisible and worthless to everyone. I struggle everyday with feeling like I matter to no one. Sometimes I wish I would just die, but then i think of how devastated my parents would be, it would kill them really. I feel like my whole life is never mine, I feel the weight of other emotions so heavily that I am overwhelmed. Is is fear of disappointing someone? What makes me feels so worthless, even when I think I have so much worth to give?  What is this feeling of dying to give others help but unable to step from my crippling fear of remaining invisible even when I step out of my she will.... the only thing people ever noticed me for was how athletic I was, now I just feel as if no one sees me.  I do not think of suicide, but I think how over this life I am.\\n\\nI am the invisible women.I honestly do not know what I am going to do with my life. I am stuck I. This pathetic state where I am too depressed to live but do not have the power to die. I get these depressive dips almost, where for about two hours I will get really sad, and nothing else matters, just kill me. But then I will have my common self, where I am just kinda sad and fed up all the time, but not to the point of where is I can not get out of bed. Then I will have a 30 uplift, where I will not feel sad or anything,mane I will think how stupid and selfish I am for saying I want to die and shit when I am not even depressed and bullshit like that. it is almost as bad as the depressive periods, since it makes me feel more worthless, so when I go to my day-to-day I am just that but more sad. I have been cutting my arm a lot more now, and I can not stop anymore. I started cutting for control and relief, but they are the two things I have lost. I am considering it now. With genuine eyes. I think I am in my day-to-day right now, but on the decline. I pray in my low point I will not do sometching stupid.Title explains it all. I have no good friends. I have people who love me, but i can not talk to them about how I feel, and when i try they brush it off as \"moody\" because I am a teenager. I settle for less and I know i should not but its not like there is anything ahead of me. I once trusted someone and told them I was about to kill myself. They called the cops (which I am extremely grateful for) and the cops questioned me, asking if i had a plan, etc. I just said what they wanted to hear, what my parents wanted to hear. I can not goto therapy because of the cost and i do not have anyone to talk to. So I am here, ranting. I do not want anyone on here to ask if i want to PM or whatever. No offense to you guys but i have trust issues, the only reason I can post this is because its not direct. I hate confrontation. So yea.... I just needed to write something out.I have nothing to live for. I do not have someone special, nothing I am excited for, nothing to leave behind. What makes you keep going?I have schizoaffective disorder. I was taking kratom for the negative and cognitive symptoms, but that turned out to be a horrible idea. I could not moderate myself and just took way too much. So when I ran out I decided to quit. That was 4 days ago.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAt the same time I quit my Effexor. I had been on 75mg for 5 weeks. My doctor moved me up to 150. Two days into that and I was a mess. I think it was causing suicidal thoughts. I wanted to go back to being stable again, which I was much more so before I started taking the Effexor. So i stopped.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI still take Wellbutrin and Latuda and Amitriptyline along with sleep meds and clonazepam as needed. But I am falling apart. I have barely stopped crying for 4 days. I have suicidal thoughts nonstop. I can not sleep. And now I have got brain zaps and nausea.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI do not know. I am just not handling things well. I called my doctor and her assistant told me the best she could do was move my appointment from next Thursday to next Tuesday. That seems like forever away.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI do not even know why I am typing this. Just to feel less lonely, I guess.I missed my appointment for anti depression. I am going to cut my wrists nowJust wrote my life story and reddit did not want me to post it and now it is gone, I will summarize key points here.\\n\\n-Three year old me wants to be a prodigy\\n\\n-Elementary school me did not do that, but bragged about it enough to not have friends until fifth grade\\n\\n-I made friends for first time but I was the loser of a basketball clique\\n\\n-I am fat\\n\\n-I go to middle school, basketball clique is no more. I fail to force myself in to a anime/meme clique.\\n\\n-I get depressed and act 2010 meme cringey but this girl is nice to me and ends up being the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. Good grades\\n\\n-Next year of middle school, my grades are good, I get in to a clique about Anime/Memes (different one), no depression and playing football. However, the nice girl is now in highschool.\\n\\n-Winter break at cadet thing, all of my friends stopped laughing at my jokes and awkward silence. Two of them get real passive aggressive and we do not talking very much but we all pretend that I am still am friends with everyone\\n\\n-Here we are, me not wanting to say I am depressed because I always thought depressed people need to get over themselves. On the internet too much, feuding with my parents, no friends, terrible physique and terrible grades. I miss the girl that was nice to me, I should have appreciated her more. I am really sad and quarantine is preventing me from making any new friends. I have turned to both YouTube for therapy videos and discord for friends, those have failed me. \\n\\n- I have a tall, wide frame. I know I am smart. I have all of this potential and I just can not motivate myself into anything anymore. I find myself wasting entire days doing nothing. I am not suicidal, but I have thought about it in the past.\\n\\n- I find myself unable to get anything done anymore, ever. My grades suck and I have not been able to do more than one assignment every forty eight for the past few months.Everything I used to love, I hate and can not seem to bring that enjoy back. Other than that, I have nothing. I just sit in my own self pity while hating everything around me. I do not want to be that person but like fuck. How bout you put yourself in my shoes and see how you like it. it is dark and disturbing is not it? Like sorry I can not be genuinely happy like other people. Sorry I can not achieve the things I want to achieve. I have just lost all hope. Maybe I am feeling this way because of being quarantined, but maybe that is a good thing because I am seeing and understanding who I really am: a fucked up individual..I am outSince the quarantine happened, the depression that I tried to repress is crawling back in. I have been neglecting my works and disappointing many people. I do not know what to doit is night, and I am just laying in the bed and crying.\\nAll that situation with quarantine, just left me alone with my own thoughts. In the last days I just ignore my friends, school. Shit! I ignore my own life. there is my birthday in one day, but can not think it like a happy day. I do not know if I will be alive. The biggest shit, I can not talk about it to someone. While I am staying in Discord with my friends, I turn off the microphone and cry. I do not want to die. I honestly do not want to die. But I do not know how I must live my life. I wrote all this, just hoping someone will read it.I am sorry in advance if this post is long and I am so grateful to anyone who is willing to help \\n\\nMy friend has struggled with depression for a long time, and they seem to be getting worse. I had a long chat with them recently and it is very clear to me that they are doing extremely poorly. They admitted to not being able to abstain from self harm at all, drinking to try and feel better, and saying that their life has no meaning and they will never be happy. They have a therapist who they do not like and believe that therapy can not help them. I do not want to go into too many specifics because I do not know if they use this subreddit, but I am at a loss for what to do. I am not doing the best myself so I feel as though I can not give the best advice. Since we had this talk they have been even more distant and I am getting really worried. We are both in our later teen years also so I feel really unqualified to help them. Their parents know that they struggle but they have never opened up about the self-harm or the fact that they are doing this bad. I do not know if I should contact their parents or if that is a bad idea because if not handled well it will only alienate them more. I am at a complete loss for what to do. \\n\\nI can pm with more information if anything will help. If anyone has any useful advice I would appreciate it so much.2020. The year I found out death really is the answer. If I was not afraid of the consequences of suicide I would have done it a lot of breakdowns ago. I can not wait until something ends me. Only way I will be with my mother again. I can not wait. sweet sweet death.The last time I saw my crush of 5 years was after graduating. That was around 2017 and a year ago I pretty much cut all feelings for her after thinking about all the rejections (5 times in total over the course of these 5 years). Because I pretty much wasted 5 years on her I was just too blind to see and too weak to let go.\\nAfter I cut all connection and feelings in early 2019 my life improved sort of, not by much but it improved. Today while grocery shopping I met her in the supermarket. We exchanged smiles and a quick ,,hi,, before going on with our shopping. The moment I saw her all the feelings, anger and depressive thoughts that I had over the years came back instantly and pretty much continued to fck with my head. Now I do not know what to do anymore, what is the mission now? I do not want to focus 2 years on recovering not being able to do nothing due to depression and me getting eaten alive by my own thoughts like what happened after graduation...\\n\\nHow do I avoid thinking about the girl I had a crush on for 5 years now since 2013...\\n\\nWe somehow agreed to stay friends after grad but some time after that we pretty much became strangers to each other and now I do not know what to do...Should I just toughen it out like I am used to until it goes away?\\n\\nI can answer anything that I might have missed, in the comments if it helps to find an answer...My mom knows the perfect ways to tear me right the fuck down. The only reason my arms do not look like barcodes rn is because I had to sit down stairs for an hour, so I just checked out. I do not remember any of that hour and now that I am alone everything\\'s flooding back and it is taking everything in me not to break a shaving razor rn. \\n\\nMy best friend is texting me but I can not tell him I want to relapse. Hes so happy that I am 4 months clean and I can not put pressure on him like that, he has a lot going on.\\n\\nI feel like I am just another teenager overreacting. I do not have a diagnosis, I have food and shelter and both parents, I am ungrateful. I do not know.I have always had trouble getting homework done because of my depression. But with my school switching to online classes I am falling behind even more and I am just ready to give up at this point.\\n\\nI can not function in an online learning environment. There is just no way I can retain information like I would in a physical classroom. And I can not bring myself to start on homework until very late when I have to rush to get it done so it is not turned in late. I waste the rest of my day watching movies, youtube, tv shows, etc. instead because nothing else brings happiness to me anymore besides that. \\n\\nI just cannot function without having the routine of waking up, getting ready, and going to school everyday. I would like some advice and want to know if anyone else feels like this. All my teachers are disappointed in me but most do not care about mental health so I can not tell them the truth.When I got 11 years old I got depression, I do not want to talk about why I got depression at 11 because it is kinda embarrassing.\\n\\nAt 12 years old shit got real... A lot of depression came from school. I can not do school work anymore because it is so frustrating.\\n\\nI can not even do my hobbies anymore.\\n\\nthere is one other reason why I am so depressed, but I do not want to talk about it.\\n\\nI am still 12 and right now all I do in life is sit In bed watch YouTube videos or watch porn and masturbait.\\n\\nI do not really know how to describe the stuff I am going through.\\n\\n Also English is not my first language so my English might be bad.I think I am going insane. I have not seen my friends for weeks. I am trapped at home and I want to die.I just want someone to vent to, talk to about my day and theirs. Someone to cuddle. But I am just ugly and do not deserve it do i? Male or female all my relationships fail. Online or irl. No matter what everyone slowly drifts away from me. Am I mean? I am losing reality.I do not really know what I am good at. I try many things like art, music or more but I do not quite enjoy it. I am just really sad because all of my classmates and other people has their own uniqueness or talent or beauty. I feel like I am a piece of shit. I do not really know what to do. I cannot understand myself.Has anyone attempted to talk to a therapist via doctor on demand? I am having a hard time dealing with and processing my life events. Considering talking to a professional as I can not do this on my own anymore. Want to know if doctor on demand for therapy has had good results for anyone else.That place is my room. The living room scares me because there were rats there not too long ago and I am not convinced they are all dead so every time I sit there I just get really anxious about the possibility that they are around here somewhere. My parents’ bedroom is a mess. There is no backyard. There is no space. I only have my room.\\n\\nMy room is the place I stayed the most out of during my recovery. I only really came in there to sleep because being there makes me want to give up and just lay on the bed with my phone or sleep. \\n\\nNow I eat, get entertainment, do/did homework, and flipping go to school on my bed. \\n\\nAnd now I am behind on a ton of my assignments because I can not seem to get any motivation. I could feel my motivation slipping away and I tried to fight it but all of my solutions were really only short term.\\n\\nNow I feel stuck literally and metaphoricallyOr at least that is what it feels like. And I do not mean just making like \"friends\" or acquaintances, I mean good friends that you always want to hangout with. Those take a lot of time, you have to hangout a lot to build that type of relationship and nobody has time to do that anymore when you are an adult it seems. All I want is a group of friends to go on a roadtrip with. Or go to the beach with. I just keep comparing myself to my ex and his group of friends, and others I have met through him. They all have a group of two or three people who they do all this fun stuff with. But anytime I meet or see anyone with a group, its always people they have met in highschool or college. I do not understand, is not there others like me? Why can not I find anyone that i really click with. Ever since this whole COVID-19 thing broke out and people began to quarantine themselves, I have been fucking depressed. \\n\\nIt began with an \"Oh, no...\" when I read the email from my university that school would be closed until MAY THE 31ST. Now, I am not exactly sure that I am depressed (am I depressed or just ungrateful?) but I do not at at all bode well with staying alone at home with absolutely nothing to do. There is slow internet, my computer is not great with running games, and going outside is, of course, out of the question. \\n\\nit is almost been a month of waking up, doing nothing, going to sleep. One can watch TV shows for only so long. \\n\\nI have been depressed for almost three years now. Depressed in the sense that I have no real ambitions, passions or physical skills that can help me out. I also have this feeling that I will never be \"somebody\". To top it all off, I have been extremely underweight for my age, have been shamed by peers since grade 1, and generally have never had a moment to look back on with pride. \\n\\nI am 23 and live with my parents. I have not told them about my depression, they simply would not get it. I do not blame them, no matter how and what they have done, they are the best parents anyone could have asked for. But the problem is me. I feel unimportant. Irrelevant. I just fucking miss going to uni because it was an escape from doing nothing. \\n\\nI do not know, whatever. Just wanted to rant it all out.To make a long story short we have been together for a little more than a year now and I love her to death. Whenever we are together it is been nothing but a good time filled with laughs and lots of food (lol).\\n\\nRecently I noticed she is been irritated with me and she said that she started to relate signs of depression to things she was feeling like feeling irritated easily, anger, self-loathing etc. also she would have the extreme thoughts of self-harm but she would never act on it. I tried to comfort her saying that I will be there for her and all that but that response turned around on me because I constantly tel her that. She wants a different response like how to comfort her or help her but I am at a lost for words and do not know what to say. \\n\\nI love her and I can see us being together for a while and I really hope this is one of those challenges that we just face and get over.\\n\\nAny help is appreciate thanks guys.I do not really mean new friends, I have no friends. This situation has me feeling hopeless since there is no known end in sight. I could see myself slipping into suicidal ideation again if They can not make any friends, can not be with people. \\n\\nI might have to start gaming again, maybe try an online game or something.\\n\\nFMLSadness is a feeling that I know I will never shake. Even when good things happen (which is extremely rare for me) and I am supposed to be happy, the feeling of sadness is always there. I have given up trying to get it to go away.I hate other people as a concept. I do not belong anywhere, not even here. I can not relate to anyone but I still feel like shit i think. I do not want to talk about it but i do not want to pretend I am fine either. I do not even know how i really feel. I rarely do. I do not know...So the one friend that I can trust to talk about shit with, just told my parents that I am suicidal. I am not pissed at her as I know she meant well but now feel like I can not trust anyone. I would have rather told my parents myself eventually as opposed to having them find out from someone else then barrage me with questions. it is not their fault as they clearly have no idea how to deal with depression/suicidal thoughts but it would like they managed to say every bad thing. Everyone involved just wants what is best for me but I can not help feel angry at them all. it is understandable as my mum thought I was happy for the last two years, but she keeps trying to tell me how it is just temporary. She also keeps wanting to know how I self harm as my friend told her about that as well. It feels like everyone is against me and I am just alone and I just do not want to go on anymore.Everyday it is something else. I am getting pushed so far and nobody realizes how deep I am in depression. I do not want to be sad, I do not want to hurt myself. But my head is crazy I can not even begin to explain the thoughts I have and I feel insane because I know it is in my head but it is still there. I do not know if anyone understands. I am at a constant battle with myself and I do not know how to make it stop. I just want to be normalNobody comes to me first when they need something. It may be a romantic partner, sexual partner, or, even about the things I know very well, they never choose to ask me first. I am always asked second or never. \\n\\nNobody chooses me.\\n\\nAnd I can not blame them.\\n\\nI would not choose me either.I am a 16-year-old guy from South America. My family have been Christians for their whole lives, and I had been too, until around 3 years ago.  I do not know why I started doubting my faith, but the fact is I do not believe in God anymore.  For 3 years I have been acting as if I did believe, and even if tedious, it has not been that difficult. Before proceeding, I need to say I have been suffering from depression and other issues. In the last year and a half approximately, I have been just getting worse and worse. I told my parents and they took me to a therapist ( thankfully), but my mom says that the efforts of anyone to help are futile without the help of God. I think I could go through with this and continue lying, but I also think I need to say the truth to her. Luckily, my mom and my dad have been trying to help me with my mood, and I really do not want to because them more trouble. that is the thing; I feel like I am tearing my family apart ( my mom has even said that because of me she wished she did not live here, she is not to be blamed for that, though), and I do not want to because them more trouble. Like faithful Christians, my parents\\' lives revolve around God ( especially my mom\\'s). I am really scared of messing this up and ruining everything. Any help will be appreciated.I know I will not be the only person feeling this, but I am struggling during lockdown, feel really isolated. I have been furloughed from my workplace, I am looking after my little girl as my wife is a key worker.\\n\\nI am just finding I am missing human interaction with my work mates and people I get on the train with. It does not help my workplace are not reaching out to me and keeping me informed, I feel like I am not allowed to reach out to them. \\n\\nI am having a good time hanging out with my little girl and seeing my wife, but I just feel isolated and a bit numb.\\n\\nJust needed to unload sure I am not the only one...Depression....wow it has run rampant. I know I have it and once in a great while I wake up and I can think. I can breathe. I can feel. I am more myself than I have been in years. Today was a day of enjoying existing. I attempted to get shit done. It did not work like I planned but that is ok. I am even ok with my recent breakup. I always want to feel this way. The brain cloud is gone. How do I maintain?I do not know if its just me but my depression comes in waves. Sometimes i would just wake up feeling like a pathetic loser after which I do not want to get out my bed. Sometimes, even the most obscure things triggers memories of my ex and absolutely wrecks me for days. Sometimes its just a feeling of emptiness and that feeling of \"what the fuck is even the point\". Then it goes away magically after a few days only to return days later.\\n\\nAlso, I have never been to a therapist so far because I feel that my symptoms are mild. But sometimes I just think everything would be so much better if life just ended right here for me. I am considering going to a therapist after the covid 19 situation calms down. Can someone explain how it seeing a therapist helps? Like what benefits does it bring assuming no medication.Who else thinks biological life is just bullsh* and unfrair. I mean, I was depressed as a teen the whole time and then lager I improved myself and know how I can actually be happy.\\nBUT. I still think life in general sucks and has the most unfair and illogical things that if a God would exist, I would give him a soft smack for, like dude what the heck man..\\nI can love life but at the same time passionately hate it.\\nLike I was born with a neurological disadvantage called autism, yes I am very thankful that I found out about the gaps diet no plants and actually I am recovering so much mentally. But I still have little energy and just life in me like what the heeeeeeck. Why is this biological life so hard???\\nI just do not understand anymore and I am just damn mad because I hate being autistic and it gets me almost nowhere because it makes you slow.\\nGoing so crazy right now like how am I even supposed to be thankful??? I mean yes I can litteraly make a list of 100 things right now but the feeling of irritation everyday just always takes over?\\n\\n\\nHow???¿?\\n\\nSorry needed to vent..I had a strange experience today. My job was getting me down as usual, so I took my prescribed depression medicine. I know it will not kick in til later, and I have to take it regularly. Still, taking the medicine initially gives one a \\'chill\\', kind of relaxing feeling.\\n\\nNot this time.\\n\\nInstead, I felt three times worse, to the point I started crying. I honesty do not understand this reaction, I have never reacted like this to any depression medicine. what is going on with me?So, the reason I am still alive is because I am afraid committing will waste all the money and time my parents have spent to raise me. I feel like I can not leave without fulfilling my obligations to them — but then it is also terrifying how empty and purposeless I will feel when they are gone.\\n\\nI am in college right now, majoring in something that will allow me to pay them back as quickly as possible (they did not ask for this; I just feel guilty for wasting their resources...). I have been struggling with depression since I was 7. Not sure why I felt like posting this today — it might be a bit of a rant after a couple of meetings where I felt like the dumbest person in the (virtual) room and this overwhelming emptiness that has been building up for a long time. My heart has been hurting since yesterday (it is the feeling of having a sad, heavy weight on your chest to the point where it is only slightly more difficult to breathe) and I thought I could sleep it out but I woke up like this too. \\n\\n(Internet) hugs for everyone here; I do not know how I am going to piece myself back together and get over the “you are useless and disgusting” feeling but this sub makes me feel less alone. Thank you for letting me vent.This may be a stupid question, but has anyone found a good way to put their hair up so they do not have to worry about it tangling/matting during a bad depressive episode? I know it is better to just brush it, but that is so insanely hard for me when I feel like this. I just want some way to put it up where it will stay and not get too tangled, and I am not sure if anyone\\'s figured out a good methodDoes anyone have any tips on how to deal with this? I work 6 straight days every week and I absolutely hate it, I am sad all the time even on off days just knowing I have to go back.I have been having a hard time sleeping and functioning lately.  Every time I go to rest, my mind will not stop thinking, whether it is about a certain game, feeling, something I said that day that I regret, my mind will find any little thing to make me stay up... it even made me paranoid last night. Without proper sleep and some other thing going on with me physically, I have been in hard core depression and shut down mode. I know I made a promise to my friends to call everyday but this promise is getting harder and harder to keep. I can not talk properly, I can not think properly, it is annoying my friend and it is frustrating me. Sometimes I wish I could not talk and that I could only speak through sign language. I would love to learn but I am too stupid to remember anything. I am turning into a stupid failure. Nothing about my life is meaningful to anyone. I am nuisance. I guess that is all I will ever be...My health insurance has a massive deductible so basically unless I am hospitalized, I pay for everything. I have done therapy in the past and although I learned a lot, I can not afford to do regular therapy sessions. My job hours have been cut because of Coronavirus and having to stay in lockdown has taken a severe toll in my mental health. For the first time I feel I need to do something to change because I am getting hopeless. I am interested in trying SSRI’s and have done some research, but I do not know what options are available to get a prescription in an affordable manner. Are there any online or call in options that have affordable appointments with the OPTION to write a prescription? I know there are some therapy options, but I would like to consider an Rs and do not think psychotherapy alone is a reasonable option. Obviously I live in America, which is why cost is such an important consideration. Thanks!This happens when I think of how miserable the future might be for me. Then I say it is ok your going to kill yourself if it gets unbearable. Does anyone else do this?Not being selfish or anything but it only makes me feel sorry for myself for not having the same life as theirs and I absolutely hate feeling sorry for myself because I feel like I am not worthy of self loveI do not want to go. I am scared of the costs. I do not want my mom and sister to find out. They are my last line of stability. My last sense of normalcy. As soon as they found out, the relationship will change forever. My dad will want to be around more which is the complete opposite of what I want. My brothers will pity me. I do not want pity.it is been a couple month since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I am scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I do not want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can not get out of this hole I am in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I will not be in this much pain constantly but I do not know if it is worth it. Sure, I will miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can not see a future for myself anymore. I do not want to die but I also do not want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that is selfish and unfair and would not solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I do not get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I do not really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I do not think I have talked to any of them in about a week (I am not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I am a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut do not have the same values. I do not know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it is just a matter of when.\\n\\nSorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.\\n\\nAlso I know that as soon as I move out I will hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the because of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that is not a possibility as I am only 16.\\n\\nMy mother knows about my mental health and how bad I am doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I am very lucky to be considered attractive, I am popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I am very privileged to be in the position I am in, I have nothing to complain about, I have had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can not find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it is not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they are right. But I am not.\\n\\nEdit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I am feeling is valid.Everything in my brain is telling me to find a mate. that is pure facts. \\n\\nWere all just animals...were peacocks going around and showing our feathers trying to impress a female peacock. So she will want us. \\n\\nAnd from the females perspective I totally get it, you only spend time and chase after and desire men who have desirable products about them. \\n\\nI just wish I had some shiny feathers.\\n\\nit is the same old game,  day in and day out. \\n\\nI am sick of being the loser. \\n\\nI am sick of knowing I am the loser.So far I have tried Effexor (no effect), Wellbutrin (no effect), and Zoloft. I took Zoloft at varying dosages, at some points alongside Wellbutrin. Zoloft helped with the extreme lows of depression, but I still felt significantly depressed in addition to feeling numb/flat, almost unable to fully experience happiness. I have been off medication entirely for around 6 months. In the last couple of months, I started going to the gym almost everyday, taking omega 3s, taking vitamin D, occasionally using light therapy, and trying to get my sleep schedule together. I was definitely still depressed but felt wayyy better than when I was on Zoloft. \\n\\nMy mental health changed for the worse very suddenly though when an ex came back into my life (bringing up old wounds that have not healed) at the same time this pandemic began. I ended up losing my job. I have been sleeping around 12 hours and once I wake up, lay in bed all day. I constantly feel like I am going to cry, I have tried my best to continue exercising but I am finding it very difficult. Yesterday I went for a walk/jog on a trail and ended up crying my eyes out (luckily I was alone in the middle of nowhere haha). I do not necessarily have a plan, but I think very often about killing or hurting myself. it is something I have caught myself fantasizing about often, even though I know it is not something I could go through with. \\n\\nI had a Facetime appointment with my PCP today. She prescribed me Viibryd, along with Zofran for the nausea side effects. She said if it was too expensive, we could try Cymbalta instead. I have not gone to pick it up yet, but the Walgreens website says it is $71 with my insurance. I found a coupon I saw people mention online and am going to try to use it. I am wondering though if Viibryd is worth the cost?  I have read good things about Viibryd from people who failed to respond to different antidepressants. I am also wondering how people who do not respond to antidepressants like Cymbalta? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Is Viibryd worth the cost for people who do not respond to antidepressants? How does Cymbalta compare?My depression fluctuates a lot, like all of us. However, I came across some old postings of mine on a different site and I literally blocked out details of traumatic things that happened to me-maybe rewrote them in my mind to blame myself as well. \\n\\nThere are also times my friends will ask if I remember how much I liked certain movies we saw together (or activities, etc) and I will tell them I have not seen them. They get frustrated because I have seen them WITH them yet I just can not remember. \\n\\nAt that point in time over a couple of years my depression was incredibly horrible. I was so close to ending it all, it scares me to think about. \\n\\nI do not know if it was the looming depression, maybe the weed I was excessively smoking, or the heavy drinking. I am just shocked by the things I do not remember-little things and huge life changing details of bad experiences. I also find it odd because I study psychology and there is not really such a thing as “blocking” it out I guess.\\n\\nAnyone else relate?  \\n\\nTLDR: At the worst part of my depression and suicidal ideation, when I look back I can not remember details of my life at that point. it is unnerving. Is this normal? Anyone relate?I have struggled with depression since I was a teen. I have dealt with anxiety, destructive friendships, fear of going out of my house,bullying, a bitter divorce who left me as the only one to take care of my mom emotionally so I had to hide my feelings just to avoid my mom to get sad. In fact, when I finally hit rock bottom was so bad that I wished for my death. \\n\\nI have come out of them thanks to having friends and the improvement of the situation of me and my mom. But since, last year depression returned. First, it was realising how I chose a career that I ended up hating, then graduating and being unable to find a job. Then realising how my friendships had started to fade away as they are beginning to have relationships and it made me worry about a near future when I will be the only lonely guy of the group. \\n\\nIt does not help that I feel my sexuality is a nightmare. I pray every night to be cured. I have been to lgbt groups but I just does not feel related to the things there, if anything it made me feel worse to be with people who put their sexuality as their main personality trait and it does not help that I live in such an homophobic country that coming out would cost me even the relationship with my mom, the only true love I have.  I do not think life would be better if I was straight as I already struggle with sharing my feelings and I am not a very romantic person but at least I could live a normal life like the ones my friends are already having. Love is nothing more than an ilussion for sex. is not that is the reason why so many marriages fall apart?\\n\\nAnd I do not think it will get better, if anything it will get worse as soon as my friends start to get married and having children. (In fairness, I would like to have a kid through adoption but I do not know if single parents can adopt). Having to live for a job I will probably hate and now due to the economic crisis that the virus will because around the world, my plan to study in Spain is likely delayed. I love my teenage years because at least being a top grades kid made my life have a meaning but now, it is sad to see even the kids who were my former bullies improving in their lifes. \\n\\nIf I had not killed myself until now, it is just for my mom and dog. If something where to happen to her, I would likely have no more reasons to live.I have struggled with depression for the past 15 years and I am not even 30 years old. i have tried to kill my self twice. it is all up and downs. there is months, or even years, where i am “normal”. and then there is times where i just spiral and lose myself. I have sat on my couch and cried for an hour for no reason today. i am tired of feeling this way, i am tired of being okay for a while and then coming back to these feelings. why should i keep going if this is how my life will be? why should even be alive if i can never escape depression? if i can be normal and function for a while and then get back to this? it makes no sense. i do not really want my life to be like this.\\ni feel like i am losing myself again. i do not want to be “living”. i do not know what to do. i am tired of all of this.I have suffered abuse all my childhood: sexual, physical and emotional.  In the last few years I have been recovering from what happened to me, but I realized that it is a long path because the abuse only stoped when I was 17 and now I am 20. Recently my anxiety has been through the roof and I do not know why. it is gotten so bad that I physically want to slam my head against a wall to stop thinking. I am tired of being overwhelmed and I am pretty sure my fiance and those around me are tired of dealing with me. I do not want to be a burden and I just want to get better. Thank you for listening and please leave some advice. I am in therapy, but I do not think it is working....I hate taking medication.I am pretty sure many people do, but to me, it gives me something to look forward to, even if it only brings me temporary happiness. I know it is addictive and bad for my self-control and wallet, but it is like I do not have much to look forward to.\\n\\nI was supposed to go to a school trip to Washington DC in May. That kept me afloat for a few weeks. But because of COVID19, that is been canceled. I used to look forward to going to my Federal Work Study job at a nonprofit. I looked forward to the commute, eating out, and even working, because anything is better than being at home. I was looking forward to max out my hours to save up for the car I hope to get at the end of the summer. \\n\\nBut nada, nothing. For now, the only thing I can look forward to is the temporary bursts of happiness I get waiting a package. After that, life just goes deeper downhill. it is been like this even before COVID19. But I could look forward to going to classes. Now I feel like I do not have much to live for...It hurts so much, everyday I am in pain. My OCD causing constant over thinking. Almost every second of everyday I am doing checking rituals. I have magical thinking which means I think I can make things happen with my thoughts if I do not do certain stuff. I can not enjoy anything because as soon as I do I feel guilty for stopping obsessing about the thoughts. Then I get intrusive thoughts about the thing. So I just flick back through the same apps everyday, stuck in my head trying to control my hole life. I try to go for a walk everyday but I am overthinking the whole time. Literally anything triggers me. Any decision I try to make ocd comes in and tries to force me into something I do not want to do. I want toast? No ocd wants me to have cereal or something bad will happen. I want to message a friend? ocd wants me to send exactly the right message, normally something I do not even want to say. Then I end up talking and talking and probably annoying people.\\n\\nThen on top of the is the feelings of worthlessness and not being good enough. From years of bullying at school. Then the guilt for the nasty ways I treated my friends because I wanted to look cool so made fun of them. Knowing if I did not my best friend would get mad at me. Saying I did not like her for hanging round with them.\\n\\nAnd finally there is the years of abuse from my alcoholic mother. Leaving me on my own at night. Coming home all bruised and bleeding. Forcing me to hug her when I did not want to. Calling me a freak, a bitch, telling me to fuck off. Gaslighting me constantly. Trying to kill her self in front of me and screaming at me to give her pills.\\n\\nI am just so broken. Life was getting better. My mother’s in prison now. I thought things were looking up but my ocd was worse. And then this lockdown and I am backing to thinking “how do I do another potential 60 years of this hell that is life”\\n\\nAnd I know this post is ranty, but I needed to get my feelings out. And no I am not going to do anything. I am too scared to kill myself. I do not even want to die I just want the pain to stop. I want to finally be happy.This quarantine made me realise how much time I was wasting during my best years. And I still do that. I had so many similar days in the past when no one forced me to not go out and I still locked myself in without feeling the wind or the sun for days. I have lost so many days by just looking at the ceiling, getting late on purpose, looking at stupid crap videos on internet or lame celebrity news. I feel so bad. I feel like I am constantly wasting time with non important things but in the same time I cannot do anything productive. Untill now, whenever I stayed hours after waking up, getting late on purpose and trying to continue a dream or just hiding under my blanket and trying to postpone the moment I have to get up, I thought it is because I had to go somewhere and have a responsibility. But now I do not have to do anything and I am still frightened. I have to do some work and I have deadlines but at least I do not have to leave the bed to do it. Or to meet people. And I still get that anxiety every morning even if I am all alone and I can make my own schedule. \\n it is like two persons inside me fighting constantly. The one that wants me to be productive and do all the things I have postponed because I said I do not have time and the one that wants me to stay away from everything and just do not use my brain at all. it is been almost 2 months since I am in quarantine and I wasted my time completely. \\nI hate this shit.I just want this sadness to end.Recently my psychiatrist gave me the diagnose of mild autism. Besides this I suffer from depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, ocd and agoraphobia. With so many mental health shit that is going on, I am starting to get more depressed and asking myself if it is worth it to go through all of this. I have not had a single day where I felt actually good without any worries in years. Life is exhausting and I am struggling to even get out of bed right now. I want to cry, but I can not, because I am emotionally not in balance. Besides everything, I can not even name a single good thing about myself anymore. I feel like I am totally out of place in this world and I have no purpose at all.i should have left you alone the first time you left me. you did the right thing I am sorry I am so selfish. now when i leave it is foreverI mean it when I say it it makes me want to end my life. It makes me feel like life has no meaning anyway and I really can not find any reason to live at all. Why even get out of bed? Every day is the same. I am losing it. I know I am not being rational but I can not help it. I cry everyday. My mom is out of work we barely have money to eat. I just can not see any way I will ever get out of this situation. I guess it is a dead end for me guys.I have hit rock bottom. I am starting to honestly believe the world will be better off without me. I stopped taking my meds, I am ready to stop going to therapy. I do not have a reason to fix myself anymore. \\n\\nDoes anyone have advice on how to find motivation to get better?I am back at square one and I can not escape this timeNo one in my life knows I am depressed, I guess I just have been for so long that I am good at hiding it. I do not know how severely it is, but it goes from almost killing myself to feeling relatively normal within a week. I know everyone has advice to tell people but I do not see how that will help? I am a teen so I still live with my family and everyone is bad mental health wise to so I feel like if they know they will hit all unravel. My brother is depressed and is making it VERY known, so I do not want to take away from that. My mom has had breakdowns in front of me sense I was a child and I act like a therapist for her. I am not sure she would even believe me. My sister is the oldest but has mild autism and can be very cruel. I just work so hard to keep everyone together and okay but I feel like I am keeping a huge secret! Sorry for the rant, it is just I can only talk about it here.it is okay if you hate me. I do too.Hi guys, I am on day 8 of 50 mg venlafaxine. I feel so anxious I can not function. I feel like I want to scream and cry at the same time. it is uncomfortable to be inside my own body right now. All I do is lie on my bed and wait for it to stop. When will it stop? Is it normal?I used to have plenty of friends in real life, then I just stayed indoors all day to avoid everyone including family. I also had 100s of friends online but now just appear offline and only have a few friends who I speak to a few times a month but we do not do anything together, I pref people that do there own thing and speak nonsense sometimes.\\n\\nI lost all my interests in real life+online and only stick to 1 game and music and have not taken care of my health in 12 years. I can just sit here doing NOTHING and thinking about shit all day aswell.I have been wondering what my real reason for committing suicide would be. I would like to think that depression itself is not that big of an issue for me and would not be the reason for potential suicide.\\n\\nI feel like if I ever did it, it would be because of the constant arguing and switching in my head, and also my consistently worsening grip on reality. it is driving me insane and I hate living like this. This is mostly a post I am making while having anxiety, so no I am not talking about committing suicide right now I am talking about the future.\\n\\nI have a LOT of potential, and I have a lot of plans and methods that could get me successful and rich in the future, I know that and I know other people have told me that, the problem is I have no motivation to. And even if I do, first of all I would have to get better.\\n\\nWhat if I get better, end up thinking everything is fine, I move on with everything and eventually find a girlfriend, and I relapse into these same thoughts? Even if I do get better, I am going to constantly live with the fear of a trigger activating and me lashing out.\\n\\nThe only reason I am seeking therapy right now is because some people believe I can be helped, even though I continue to believe I am completely out of reach and beyond help at this point. I think there really is just a point where someone has been through so much that nobody is capable of helping them. \\n\\nMaybe it would not be such a big deal if I did not have certain triggers, because then my dark thoughts could be easily drowned out, but no, my mom had to be a despicable piece of shit and treat me horribly. And of course, dad was never there, and when he was, he was raping my mom and forced me to watch, so god knows what fucking psychological impact that had on my brain.\\n\\nI am not sure I can even push this shit out of my head. I have tried overpowering my triggers and telling myself “it is fine it is whatever it does not matter you will get past it” and it just makes the triggers worse. \\n\\nit is to the point where any amount, even an insignificant amount, of any representation of anxiety from rejection and abandonment, can set me off. Even if I was not self isolating, I legitimately do not understand basic, normal human interaction and I can barely even talk to anyone properly. I do not know what normal friendships and relationships are. I have never known, and I do not know what love is and I can not love, which I have explained before I think.\\n\\nSorry I can not really stick to one train of thought with these posts. I will be really surprised if someone can somehow get into my head, get past all the split personalities, get past all the manipulation and lying and fake personas, and convince ME that I can get better, that life is worth living, and that someday I will not feel like such a danger.I am in my mid 20s, working and going to Uni(atm online courses bc of corona)  \\nI feel ashamed for writing this, but my mind is full of dark thoughts at the moment and I just want to get it off of my chest before i suffocate.\\n\\nI am stuck at work at the moment I might need to put up an all-nighter since last week I could not get out of bed and I have fallen behind with Uni and work stuff. To be honest I am falling apart but I am a pretty good actor, so no one has noticed. My depression comes and goes, and this time its horrible. My whole body feels heavy, especially my chest, I can feel my heart pounding the whole time. \\n\\nMy thoughts are racing and the only thing that I want is to go to bed, hide my head under the cushion, and cease to exist. The worst part is this feeling in my head and eyes.   \\nDo you know that feeling that you get when you are emotional, seconds before you start crying?  \\nLike when you are cutting onions and you try to hold your tears back. For some days I have been constantly feeling like that. It is truly horrible. I want to scream, hit the wall with my head until it stops and then some more.  \\nAside from that I am a fucking Idiot, due to some stupid decisions I now only have around 15 euros in my bank account. I truly loath myself. If I could somehow get out of this body and be in the same room with myself, I would beat me up until I showed some of the drive that I used to have in my teens.  \\n\\n\\nMy thoughts are not even that consistent at the moment. I can feel insanely sad and angry and then suddenly feel as dry as sand emotionally.  \\n\\n\\nI wish I had someone to share this to be honest, I wish I could would feel loved.   \\n\\n\\nAs the sun is setting down and I am here alone, I have this faint voice that tells me to jump outside the window. But shit, have you ever tried jumping outside a window? Your whole body freezes and you can not move any muscles. Your hands get all tingly and sweaty, your skin cold. You breath slowly but heavily. Memories start to pop up in your head, of people who love you, mom, dad, friends.  \\n\\n\\nI will never give up on life though.  \\nI do not know if there is anything after death but I doubt it, I believe it to be like going under anesthesia, devoid of consciousness one returns to nothing. And that is a truly sad but also reassuring thought.I have not felt this low since back when i was addicted to pills and sat in my dark ass room all day getting high. This quarantine shit is real bad, I am spending everyday in the same room I would be sad in. I miss college and seeing my girl. Fuck this house and my family. I am sure lots of people feeling this way too.I have been in and out of therapy for 3 years but my slow progress with my current T has been discouraging me from coming in because it feels like I am not getting better. When I am in therapy, It feels so uncomfortable looking at each other when none of us know what to say. My poor memory makes it very difficult to talk about anything. How can I talk about anything when I can not remember anything? I am just forcing things out. This makes me start thinking that I am wasting my time and money which makes me feel guilty about going. I get out what I put in. I write long notes before each session but It dosent always help the conversation going. My low tolerance for frustration, poor motivation, impulsiveness, pettiness, unrealistic expectations and crazy work schedules has made it difficult for me to be in therapy at times.\\n\\nWhen I first started I thought that I could just show up and have my therapist make me feel better. I thought that I could quickly get rid of my suicidal thoughts after a few months, recover from withdrawal and never look back on seeing a therapist/pdoc ever again.Hi guys, I am sure my story is pretty common around here and I know that it is not as bad as it could be, but I really do not know what to do.\\n\\nI am a junior in college and this semester has a few of assignments coming up. I am not sure if I can even do them. I have a hard enough time getting out of bed to eat. I have no idea how I am supposed to tackle some of these things. \\n\\nI am just lost. When I think about anything that is due, I just sink lower in my bed. There are plenty of other things I need to do but I just do not think I have the energy anymore.\\n\\nThis post is really just a way to share my thoughts. I do not expect something to come from it.too sensitive too obsessive too delusional too creative too misunderstood. i am not made for this world. \\n\\nliving on this planet is soul crushing. \\n\\ni broke down in the shower this morning. i can feel that my last days are near. i will soon be freeHi I am a 17 yr old guy and i do not really know where else to turn to, everyones shut me out, my therapist will not see me and I am going fucking crazy. I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything i have not been sleeping because i only have fucked up dreams. Nothing feels real whenever someone tries to talk to me i have extremely bad dissociative episodes that last anywhere from 20-30 minutes. My dad and his girlfriend treat me like 2nd class as if I am not worth anything and I am just so sick of it I am so tired of trying to be a normal fucking person this is all just too much for me to handle half the time i do not feel anything then the other half my emotions are controlling me. I feel like the empty she will of what used to be a person. People kept trying to bite away at me and leech off me to get what they want out of me but its happened to persistently that there is nothing left to take i feel like i died a long time ago and I am in hell now. I can not even cry there is no tears left. I do not know what to do.I keep fighting it but I do not know why. I am so tired. I am stuck in a cycle. I fight through everything, nothing comes easy for me, this world is not made for me. I fight through my school work even though I know I am doing it wrong and I do not understand anything. I dread the tests, they destroy my confidence in myself. Music is my escape. At this point idk why I am writing this. If this gets posted idk why I posted it. I am a mess. I do not want to think about the future, I am scared. What do I do? I hate this. I am angry and what to cry at the same time. Why does it have to be like this? Will it get better? Just please tell me everything will be alright. Why am I writing this? Why am I going to post it? Why? Why? Why? I will shine one day, and everything will be fine. Please someone tell me it is going to be alright. If you read this whole thing, thanks. Bye for now.Just... Fuck. I can not take this. I am not going to commit suicide but... Fuck. Fuck me, fuck them... Fuck IT. Fuck the pain, fuck the wheight. The... You know IT. That thing that makes you wonder how you are still alive, how could you survive all this time without killing yourself. Fuck this feeling. Fuck this... Wound, this... Hole, that is in my chest. It seems... Permanent. Immortal. Fuck it. Fuck it.Hey everybody. I am (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she is been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.\\n\\nThis past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she is been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.\\n\\nNow what is even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she did not want to burden him and ruin the great life he is provided for her.\\n\\nSo I am really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. she will stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she does not want to me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.\\n\\nI have been researching a lot about depression and what I should and should not do. I have looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. \\n\\nReddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I would support her no matter what.So little bit of context: my grandparents come from a small mountain village where the head of the family decides everything. That behavior continues even now in Belgium. Now my mom who cares for my grandparents is always mad and takes it out on me...\\n\\nStory: me and sister(sis)\\n\\nMe: I going crazy from grandparents shouting \\nSis: just keep calm and help mom with dishes and chores.\\nMe: no why would I she is always mad and ungrateful.\\nSis: well maybe you should wake up earlier that would help\\n\\n(I almost sent) \\nMe: honestly I do not know whether I even want to wake up.)Today I woke up and felt a bit better. I did not feel depressed much but after a few hours I feel like I want to die again :/ ( Was like this before the virus)I have had depression for a while, pratically since middle school (I am 21 now btw) and just recently I was actually having a good time with life and wanted to get out of bed. I felt comphortable around people and for the first time in a long time knew what I was doing,, I was dare I say it actually happy for a bit. But then the whole quarantine thing happened and it kind of sent me on a downward spiral of what the best way to describe it is sort of loneliness and self hatred. \\n\\nThe main thing that kind of started said spiral was when none of my friends ever called to check up on me, it is something minor and so so petty I feel like a fucking 13 year old girl talking about it (No offense to any 13 yr girls out there, I am talking about the sterotype.) And I feel wrong for being bummed out by that. \\n\\nSo I guess to sum it up or a tl;dr, was anyone else kind of a bit happy before the self isolation/Quarantine.\\n\\n(Sorry that none of this makes sense, I just really needed to write this down and tell someone, even if it was to a bunch of rando\\'s. Thanks for reading this far)I do not get it. I just do not get it. What possible fucking reason would anyone have for actually caring about me? What on God\\'s green Earth could I possibly give back in a relationship? I am annoying, I am clingy, I am attention seeking, I yell and scream at the drop of a hat, What possible benefit could they see in me? Sure, ***maybe*** I have some strengths (not even sure about that tbh), but they do not outweigh my flaws, and they are not exactly useful in a relationship (I do not think anyone wants to be my friend because I can write a decent paper). So what the fuck is it, then? What could they possibly see in me that makes dealing with all my bullshit worth it? \\n\\nit is like I have a bomb strapped to my chest that is about to go off; I keep on telling people to get away or they will get hurt, but they just refuse to acknowledge the bomb\\'s existence. \\n\\nI am just so tired of explaining this to people.my emotions have been all over the place today. i feel like a fking yoyo. I have literally gone from feeling on top of the world happy to super upset/angry/nervous to laughing to crying to angry again to overwhelmingly lonely... i have an app that tracks emotions on like a graph and there are so many sharp spikes just in the last 24hr period because i try to add stuff every time i feel something or when something happens. the last sort of month tho, the graph looked mostly flat and in the lower third of the graph but today its clearly very different. sure some stuff has happened today but only small events nothing huge that would warrant for intense emotions so its annoying or maybe stupid to be reacting intensely over little things, even when its a positive reaction? i also hurt myself today to uh lol that is another fun thing to add todays list of events. and I am literally so tired! its so tiring to go from happy about one event to another situation making you really upset or mad to something else making you feel happy again. I am exhausted! and like sure... I am NOT FEELING NUMB TODAY so that is a good thing, right? i should not be complaining about this or even recording its existence because feeling something is better than not right? \\nI have been complaining a lot about feeling numb resently and today its almost like I have felt enough intense and extreme emotions for atleast a month. maybe all this time I have felt depressed lonley or numb I have just been saving up all my other emotions just for today.  but it really does not feel like a good thing i do not think. sure, good that I am not numb and sure I have been happy today but I have also felt really low too. how do i really know how I have felt today when my emotions have been crashing all over the place? i literally can not work out what my average emotion is for today but i can tell you that i am now exhausted. this is all so annoying.I literally called my doctors office to ask a question and the lady kept interrupting and would not let me finish what I was saying. it is no big deal, I am sure she just wanted to hurry up and get me off the phone because she was busy. But as soon as I hang up I start tearing up for no reason at all. Like, it should not be a big deal, but I cried involuntarily anyways. Just wondering if anyone else cries over little things that should not matter?I hope this pandemic ends soon so everyone goes to their stupid lives so I can have a few hours alone againMy mother had cancer for 3.5 years and had already gone through one bout in hospice, which she eventually left because she got so much better. I think her long illness and repeated improvements lulled me into a false sense of \"there is still time\".\\n\\nMy mother was put into hospice again on Friday April 3rd and told she had a \"few weeks\". This time I knew it was for real. I saw her on Saturday and on Monday and she seemed to be doing pretty well and she texted me on Wednesday saying that she felt she was going to linger a week or two more. Instead she died on Friday the 10th. 2 days after that text. She was only home a week before she died.\\n\\nMy sister flew in to be with her the second she was released from the hospital and put into hospice. I work in an ER so I am considered high risk in these COVID19 times so I just visited 2 times from the day she came home from the hospital to the day she died and both times I had to maintain some distance, I could not hug her, and my sister did not want me staying very long (1-2 hours). I tried to see her on Thursday but she said she was too tired for a \"visit\". So I finally got fed up with not seeing her more and I applied for FMLA so I could be with her 100% until she died. Make more memories. Take care of her. Not just be a \"visitor\" but be her \\\\*daughter\\\\*. But the day I FINALLY decided to do that, the next day, thinking she had at least another week for me to be with her, she suddenly crashed and died. I waited too long. WHY DID I WAIT AT ALL? Why did not I understand how little time she had left? Why did it even matter? Why did not I call my work the second she got released from the hospital and said, \"I am not coming back to work until she has passed, no matter how long that takes\" or just quit and told them to use my PTO to cover my last 2 weeks. The stupidest thing is, I was going to quit my job soon anyways because I am going to grad school. I think I just got hung up on being afraid to lose my health insurance, or being unemployed for months, or thinking I could not be gone for weeks (when i thought she would last weeks). But none of those things actually mattered. I did not even have a financial incentive to stay because my dad told me he would cover my expenses until I left for grad school if I wanted to quit. I thought about FMLA but did not apply for it until it was too late.\\n\\nI managed to get there in time to say my goodbyes, I got to tell her I loved her and she managed to say it back, and I stayed with her in her final hours although she was heavily sedated. But I can not forgive myself for not being there with her in those last days. I could have BEEN THERE, getting hugs and watching tv with her and saying goodnight to her in person every single night.....and I was not. She probably thought I cared more about my stupid fucking job than her.\\n\\nI just do not understand how stupid I was. Why did I keep delaying leaving my job, when I was going to quit soon anyways? Why did I assume she had weeks, I should have known she could die at any minute? Why did not I press my sister to let me be there more? Why was I ever content with \"visits\"? Why did not I even consider being there 24/7 until it was too late?\\n\\nI have no real good excuse for why I did not quit, why I was not there with her. I honestly do not understand what I was thinking.\\n\\nI could have been there and I was not. Day after day. I will never be able to forgive myself. All the time and memories lost. I could have gotten hugs. I can not even remember the last time I got a hug from my mother because of COVID19.\\n\\nI would give anything to go back. Anything. I feel like I am going insane from the regret.\\n\\nI miss my mom.I will just jump right into it.\\n\\nMy family wants to know my drugs history. Should I tell them? \\n\\nI asked for assistance long ago to help with my depression from all my family. The first thing they asked was what is \"mind altering\" drugs have I taken.\\nI said nothing believing that drugs is not what caused my depression, but in fact my family. This is when my anxiety went through the roof. I just wanted to tell them it is their fault. \\n\\nNow after the long period of time of receiving no help I just want to text my family the list of drugs and then see what they do.\\n\\nIs this the reason they have been so useless in dealing with my depression. Is it worth the shit storm that will follow?Describe your experience of depression using a metaphor.\\n\\nHere’s mine:\\n\\nI convince myself I have made the world quite haphephobic. I take up far too much space to steady the nervous, staggered breathing of an earth which seems to desire nothing but twenty one years’ worth of distance from my heavy limbs; an earth in need of separation from my desperately broken mind and body.I have a boss who to takes every opportunity to make me look like an incompetent in front of the Partners. I am on my trial period, and I am worried that she might give me a bad review, especially since every company is cutting part of its personnel, do to the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\nHow should I handle the situation? I am working as hard as humanly possible, and I have not  confronted her. I have been really polite and warm. I am trying my best not to \"poke the lion\", but I am not able to think straightforward anymore.\\n\\nCan anybody give me an advice on how to deal with others? This has been a pattern, I have to admit, in previous jobs. However, this time I  am aware of my weaknesses, I am doing therapy to handle my social anxiety, and I am conscious and very careful in every word I say, and everything I do.My country is on semi Lockdown; \\n\\nWe are only allowed to head out to get essential items and have to be home all the way. \\n\\nor if you are an essential worker. \\n\\ni am tasked to head back to work every two days once, which very tiring to be honest the days i am not allowed back to work, i have to work from home. \\n\\non top of that, I HATE STAYING AT HOME. I simply hate it. It makes my thoughts worst. \\n\\ni am never happy at home... even though home is supposed to be the happiest place in the world. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have bought up to 40 random games on steam which all of which i can only play for an hour. \\n\\nOtherwise, I get annoyed and my thoughts run amuck. I have tried everything i could from netflix to weird online courses. \\n\\nAt least i get to head back to work every two days once. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI do not know how would i cope with this....\\n\\nI am sure i am not alone and there many of us out there...\\n\\nJust wanted you to know you are not alone. \\n\\nHope this ends soon </3I have never been truly depressed until now I feel. I have had terrible anxiety and consistent derealization for the past 2 years but I cope. But holly this quarantine is hitting a new lever of depression. It takes me hours to get out of bed. When I do I just feel like breaking down. My girlfriend who is everything to me is going through the same thing but much much worse and I am always worried about her. She calls me because I am the only one who genuinely helps. Now in her defence, she is literally amazing. She cares about me so much and does not just shove her problems onto me she goes slow with her issues and only talks about it when she really needs to. Anyway but now her parents forced her to take a night shift at a paper rout job from 1:00 to 5:00 am. I will barely be able to talk to her and her being what helps me and me being what helps her is not going to end well. I am very much ranting right now and completely lost my train of thought but holy shit this quarantine is not going well.Hello.\\n\\nI did not know if this is the right place, but I just need this to be heard.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am 15, and I right to you from the middle of a coronavirus lockdown. Luckily, where I live my country has been very proactive and has a had a low fatality rate, but that is besides the point. The national quarantine has given me time to reflect on my life and I do not know what to do with my findings.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI come from a very loving family, who gave me the best life and love possible. But for as long as I can remember (until recently, more about that later) and according to my parents I had anxiety starting at age 2. This impacted me on a completely different scale that I can not barely begin to describe. I hated myself. I hated the way I looked, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the way I walked. You name it, I hated it. This day to day alienation of myself as a person stopped me from living a normal child\\'s life. I never signed up for sports, or for music or nothing. I never had the confidence to even take the chance - because I always felt that I was so wrong the less chance I had to be wrong the easier my life would be. I would turn down birthday parties and other social events because I did not want to say something or be judged or make a bad impression etc. I remember in my first year of primary school, we were played this movie about an orphanage, who had a caregiver who banned all stuffed animals and teddys (probably not the best movie to show to a bunch of 5 years old). This lady hated them so much she would burn them and make the kids watch. I can vividly remember coming home that day, quiet, acting like it was a normal school day - but there was one thought I could never clear my head off. The burning of the toys. It was not until that night and from memory about two months after where I would hide my stuffed animals under my pillow when I went to bed, and kept myself awake - on guard almost in case such a thing happened to me as well. That is something my parents never found out about. At the age of five, I can remember being worried that my house was going to burn down in my sleep, to the point where I would keep all my most treasured belongings in plastic bags, ready to flee the house with. I can remember being scared that someone was going to murder me in my sleep or kidnap me and hold me hostage till the day I die. I suffered from much more intense and violent nightmares than my peers. The thing that I am still confused about, is that despite that I lives in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country and had a caring family, was that I still suffered from these things. I was so worried about things getting broken or something going wrong, that despite how desperately I wanted something to work or happen, I was too scared of failure to even try in the first place. I was always trying to be the happy/friendly kid, just for the sake of everyone else which made sadly too much sense at the time, but now it makes no sense..\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLike all people (i hope) we carry burdens. My burdens was that my grandfather died when I was seven, due to cancer. The day of his funeral, I was asked by my parents if I wanted to go and I was so worried about looking weak and upset, that I went to school like it was a normal day, while the rest of my family faced something I can not even imagine now. I remember hating myself for years and years over that decision, because I loved him to bits and I never got the chance to say goodbye. My only memory of him is me returning home from school that day, and my dad showing \"program\" and me seeing his photo on the front page. I have never been to his grave since because a) I am to scared to ask my parents where it is because I am worried about opening up and b) the fear that it will worsen my feelings now. My lack of attendance at his funeral ate me away inside for years, I remember weeks on end where I would cry myself to sleep in silence each night, but never told my parents and still have not. It was only when I had a breakdown in I think at the start of Grade 8 when I only told my mum half the story, the regret. Not the amount of pain it caused me. I do not think I will ever be able to tell them because it sounds just too pathetic. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt was not the middle of Grade 8, that I began to get a grip back on my life. At my school, in eight grade it was compulsory to take a performing arts subject, this could either be music, art, drama or dance. You could either do two arts for one semester each or one for the whole academic year. So I choose 1 semester of drama and 1 semester on dance. I only choose these because I did not know what else to do. These classes were mixed gender, which I found really hard because for Grade 1-5 I was at a mixed gender school and then 6-7 I was at a boys only. I found it hard because I had barely settled in and any sense of security or even a wall to hide behind was completely removed. I found the first few weeks of the course really hard, could barley look anyone straight in the eyes and mumbled my way through every social situation, even if it was a simple \"Hey! How are you?\". I just could not do it. I remember considering dropping out and changing to music, and my mum said to me \"Just give it some time, it will be fine.\" And I have been so happy that I listened to that advice. I owe my happiness and emotional freedom in life to my drama teacher, she pushed me and pushed me, to achieve confidence and it payed off. It was so successful to the point where I changed to a full year course, took for the whole year in Grade 9 and the same in Grade 10. I even signed up for the school\\'s musical which sadly got cancelled, but you get my point.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, despite that I now have been dealing with the same sort of issues/dreams/constant pessimism again like when I was five. Recently, I have been so worried about death due to the coronavirus that on a frequent level I am having dreams involving comas, death of whole family etc. I seem to be more and more often wishing I was not who I am. On a frequent scale, I think to myself \"Imagine how good my life would be if I was born in the UK\" etc. Sometimes I wish I am a celebrity or sadly just someone who gets heaps of attention. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI know that I just dumped a lot of stuff on you guys but here are the main questions I need answered please:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* How do I make up for that lost time, I spent worrying about everything?\\n* What do I do about my grandfather.\\n* What do I do about wishing I was someone else.\\n\\nLike I said, I do not know if this is the right place, but your input would mean so much.I work for an online retailer/shipment company. Idk if I can name them or if that is not a rule here, but they start with an A.\\n\\nAnyways, I have fibro and am in  pain constantly. I submitted an accommodation request and had my dr sign off on it for a minor part of the job. They ended up denying it because I was not technical enough. I was feeling depressed enough working there already, but this really adds on to it.\\n\\nFor those of you who do not have fibro, the cold is excruciating and I am more prone to injuries in the cold.\\n\\nI have not been back for a month and I am finally going back today, but I am scared. I have been crying about it all morning and I would rather do anything than go back to that hellscape. The thought just fills me with so much despair. I have been in a depressive funk already bc of the covid crisis, so it is all piling on.\\n\\nJust thinking of stepping through those barred, rotating doors makes me want to die. It all just fills me with so much dread.I have (20F) always struggled with mental health but in the last year and a half, my depression got severe to the point of suicide being on my mind at all points of every day. I have been living with my boyfriend of over a year for a few months and found out recently that he had been buying nudes from some random girl on Snapchat (not even a hot celebrity, just some girl that lives in our state). I already had no hope, no love for myself, no trust for him, etc. and really do not know how to cope. I am not going to leave him because I feel like I do not deserve any better and would not have a better relationship with someone else anyways. I really do not know what to do anymore. Especially with being cooped up all day everyday during quarantine with him.I am fat. I am worthless. And I am a loser. My brother even says that my mom thinks I am obese. He told me they might have to put me on fasting. I do not even eat that bad. it is just that it is so hard to workout during quarantine. My family’s gym is closed so I can not do a class there. And the zoom classes are always when I do school. My family always wants me to do stuff around the house and whenever I try to do something I usually get yelled at because of some little mistake. My brothers hate me. I am failing science (a C is considered a fail in my house My brother and I have to have at least all B’s).  I am sick of quarantine. I just want it all to end. I have had thoughts about how I am better off dead but then I am all like “I can not die yet, we have t gotten a sonic adventure remake.” But even then that is not enough. Whenever I get depressed around my family my dad just tells me to stop being a bitch. And then they all laugh at me. I know he is probably right on how I am such a sensitive bitch. My only ways to escape from it all is watching tv, going on Reddit, and drawing. I would say talking it out with my cat by my brother is usually in my room and he would just think I am insane. Whenever I am around people I decide to just put on a happy face and hide the pain. Whenever something humiliating or something regarding hate for me goes on I just write down negative things on a piece of paper. I do not know how many times I have wanted to kill myself.My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “you are praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”\\n\\nBear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I have told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.\\n\\nIANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*\\n\\nI have nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.\\n\\nAny advice how to break this spell?\\n\\nEDIT: If I am grieving anything, I am grieving my mother’s lost four years. I have met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! it is OVER!”Its been a very rough couple of months, especially with this corona forcing us to be together when she \\'hates me\\'.\\n\\nQuick summary: S.O. of three years has had a history of depression and I think it is very bad right now (seeing a psychiatrist this week, makes constant suicidal thoughts). Our first year was really great but she got pregnant accidentally, it was stressful but we moved in together and started making it work. Ever since she was pregnant, and even after baby our relationship has been on a downward trajectory (sometimes it had highlights).\\n\\nSpecifically some major things are our intimacy fell off a cliff (which has been huge for me, she says I am gross, does not find me attractive, \\'not a real man\\' etc), she tears me down a lot, says I am stupid, lazy, NEVER wants to hug/kiss/hold hands, tells me she hates my family (we are living with them right now for free for the last half year, and they really went out of their way to try to make her feel welcome), does not like doing anything fun any more, ALWAYS wants to fight etc etc.\\n\\nI am not perfect at all, and I have gone way out of my way to listen to her, to fix whatever she is angry about and all it does is make her want more and more. We had a huge fight (seems like 1/week honestly) where she saw I was texting my sister and friends asking for relationship advice and had some huge melt down that I \\'betrayed her\\' and she took baby and drove a few hours to her parents and said she is never coming back and I can get baby in a week.\\n\\nMy question is can depression \\'change\\' someone this much? She was once very loving, very caring, someone I ENJOYED being with. These days it feels like I am just care taking someone on the verge of admitted self-destruction. I feel trapped because we have a kid together. I truly want it to work out, but likewise if she really just \\'hates me\\', does not want to hold hands, thinks I am so stupid and gross not sure what future there is. I am secretly hoping this is not the \\'real her\\'. Can you guys give me a little insight? Thanks... but these are my friends and I feel horrible to keep telling them I can not talk rn/ sorry I am really tired/ etc as it feels selfish.\\n\\nWhy is this on the depression forum? I have previously gone through several month long depressive periods and in fact just got out of one in February! But now I feel tired all the time, can not get out of bed, can not do basic productive tasks, worst of all I just feel so irritated when I hear a human voice.\\n\\nI have never found myself self isolating before. Maybe because I have never had this many people close to me. It feels good to have friends. I do not want to just shrug them off.\\n\\nAdvice? Ty for reading. \\n\\nSo, how you just read in the tittle yeah.\\n\\nI´m 18 and i was about to get a job to have money, but when the corona and quarentine started i stopped.\\n\\nMy parents are the ones who choose my college and the ones who are paying for it. (They´re divorced btw)\\n\\nMy big sister college is about: 934 USD\\n\\nMeanwhile mine is actually 79 USD.\\n\\nI was just told that they don´t have enough money to pay for it and that they don´t see me \"Ready\" for the life. My mom told me that i never go out and that i don´t work and that i´m always in my PC.\\n\\nLike. We all have to be in our homes... so... i can´t do anything about it. I´m stressed and i don´t know what to do.Until a couple of months i was sure that i would become a music artist which has always been my dream. I know that i have talent. And i definenty do not say that to brag but i know i do. I have played the piano all my life and I am pretty good at producing music too. I now know that I will never be what i always wanted to be. And that is because i will never try. I have suffered from a crippling fear of rejection all my live and I am painfully introverted when it comes to expressing myself. My dad is also very skillful when it comes to music and has an amazing voice, yet he has never done anything with this. I have now realized that this is because he is the same as me.\\nWith that realization i also realized that I will never be anything either. I will be just like him, just a regular person who will live a regular life and then die and be forgotten. I have never told anyone about this because as i said I am so damn scared of being laughed at or not taken seriously. It feels like everyones fate is already decided through their genes and we can not do anything about it.\\n\\nDoes anyone else have similar issues or know something that helps?I have not washed my sheets in ages. My duvet has a massive patch of blood on it that I have not cleaned up from yet another relapse. I have not brushed my teeth in weeks. I may as well give up. I feel disgusting but I am too depressed to do anything about it.its like swiming in the sea trying to go out but just go deeper and further from the coast, and everybody talks you like you were shit because you can not swim and get to the coast, i supouse that one day of this i just will get the strong will on my mind to just end this, but at the moment, i ll continue swiming in this sea.Hello again, this is deleted user StupidDumbFuckhead here. Around a week ago, I made a post on how I wanted to delete my memories and stuff because my life was cringe, and every action I make, I think it is cringe. I am a gamer, but I restart video games often. I do not like the save files there. Even if I restart, I think it is still cringy, and I want to restart again! Plus, I have OCD hand washing problems. And I am autistic, so some of this may be dramatic. And I think that deleting my memories would be the perfect way to cure this \"mini-depression\" before it gets worse.\\n\\nWhile I was a happy \"child\", and now in my teenage years, I am a bit depressed, it might just get worse. I have a terrible attitude, and I have been trying to \"change\" it since July 2017, but it keeps getting worse. And with this STUPID COVID-19 existing, forcing me to use the confusing program known as \"Microsoft Teams\" instead of just going to my Special Needs class at my High School, I keep missing stuff, since I do not use my iPad that my schoolwork is on every day. And I could change that. But I will not.\\n\\nAnd now, my stupid mother decided that I should \"heal my hands\", so she got rid of my soap and water. They may look terrible, but I am going to fucking die now. She does not know about how big this mistake is. And I could had avoided all of this bullshit this morning! But I did not. Instead, I was stupid. I woke my mom up instead of using the other soap. I am so fucking useless. Now I have to limit my bathroom uses, because of her. You see, I had pee problems since I was 7. And no matter how many squares of Toilet Paper I use, pee goes on my hands just from WIPING it. My mom thinks I piss myself, when in reality, I do not. Pee just goes on my hands from wiping it. And I can not wash my hands off. So now my hands have to be dirty, and they will smell like shit as well. All because of my fucking mother. I fucking hate her.\\n\\nBut, if I delete my memories, then I will not have to deal with any of this! Then I will not restart my games, and think it is \"Cringe\" when I first start them, since I will not remember playing them again! Then I will not know everything I touch will smell like shit since I will not be smelling my hands one-thousand fucking times in a few seconds. Then I will be even more stupid as fuck, so then I can become smarter! Then, my body will not be stupid as well, and maybe it could reconnect to my brain again! AND THEN MAYBE I will FINALLY STOP MAKING CRINGY CHOICES, GET RID OF THIS DEPRESSION BEFORE IT STARTS, AND FINALLY BE A FUCKING GENIUS LIKE I WAS MENT TO BE! I HAD ENOUGH OF MY FUCKING LIFE! I NEED WAYS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MY MEMORIES RIGHT THIS INSTANT!\\n\\nIF YOU TELL ME TO CHANGE, I WILL JUST PRETEND THAT it is COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE, SINCE I am A FUCKING STUPID CUNT WHO NEEDS HER MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE!\\n\\nI AM FUCKING LOSING MY SANITY AND I do not FUCKING CARE!\\n\\nI JUST WANT MY MEMORIES TO FUCKING DIE AND PERISH FOREVER IN AN ABYSS THAT WILL SOON BE ERASED!\\n\\nI want to BE FUCKING MINDLESS!\\n\\nHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-I was excitedly planning our wedding, that was probably going to be moved back but still going to eventually happened, happily and with great enthusiasm for so long. I was so excited to call her my wife and marry her and just be with her forever, or as long as we could on this Earth. At least a couple of decades... To do this, I would get inspiration from wedding subreddits and share them with her when I saw something she might like. Now that she is passed away, seeing these posts just jab me in my heart. I will not be marrying the love of my life. she is gone. I go to unsubscribe, but then I feel like I am just giving up on her and what was going to be, and I just can not do it. I miss her so much. My heart is weak and feeble. I feel fragile. I love her. I love her. I love her. I want her back so much. I would do anything. Is it bad that sometimes I wish I could just join her in death? there is a small chance I would see her again then...Those days where you can not get out of bed, thinking there is no point because you will waste the day anyways. Sleeping 12-15 hours on and off and getting up groggy, feeling no different than if you had not been sleeping. Still feeling tired both physically and mentally?\\n\\nOr\\n\\nThose nights where you get 2-4 hours of sleep. You lie down early but all you can think about is if you have already had your highest of highs. Maybe it just does not get better than this. You are so damn sleepy but your head will not quit. You have those dark circles and bags under your eyes, and your mind does not even stop as if it will not let go of that feeling?I can not sleep at night, so I wake up really late in the morning. Then I rush around, try to have a shower without zoning out for an hour, do my makeup, get all my work done, so that I can go outside in the garden because I know its good for me. And sometimes, I can not motivate myself to go out in the garden for 5 minutes. I know vitamin D is good for health, but sometimes i feel like it is pointless so sit out in the cold with my negative thoughts. I know I should be soaking up the sun, taking care of myself, but its really hard, can anyone else relate? :/There just is not real or fair opportunity for so many ppl. Why do I need to go on bc my parents thought they were capable of bringing life into this shitty world they also thought was good enough for offspring. I only am ever hated on. Some ppl do not want to see you successful and only want to see you suffer. Why go on for a life that will only get worse and accomplish nothing just to die. I feel like I have nothing left. No motivation whatsoever to be social again. No motivation to be creative again. To others I am worse than a barcode. I wish I could take someone\\'s place, someone who actually wants this chance at life.This quarantine thing really got me acting up. I am a 15 year old girl, and since this corona virus things have been going downhill. I have had major body image issues, used self harm to punish myself if I was not a certain weight, and got diagnosed with clinical depression about a year ago. I have asthma, so that is why my mother is really really strict about going outside right now. I get it, but I have not been outside my backyard for a good month, and ot\\'s really suffocating. I know everyone is going thru this, but my friends being my support system and me not being able to see them has made my mental state decline rapidly and has me cutting again. Also I have never been the rebellious type. Getting drunk a few times  was all I have ever done which could be considered \\'rebellious\\'. But since a week I just want to go my own way. I snuck out of the house at 3am a couple of times to drink, had my first cigarette and did drugs for the first time. All within a week. I know it is bad and I should stop as soon as possible but I just can not if that makes sense. This is the only thing that is keeping me kind of \\'sane\\' rn. This is probably going to get lost anyway, but hey if you, random stranger, sees this have you got any advice?I have recently lost my job, I tell people it was because they had run out of work. When really it was because I was a shit worker, not because I refused to do the work. But I have never been a fast learner and have always found the hardest way to do things. Now I am applying for jobs but can not shake this massive feeling of anxiety that it will turn out the same. Unable to learn and do anything without having someone hold my hand the whole time.\\n\\nI have lost my license, and my partner does not have one so I was the only way for her to get to work so she could earn money to support us both.\\n\\nI have bills out my ass. \\n\\nNo sense of direction and purpose in life, and having no idea what to do genuinely fucking sucks. I honestly do not know what to do, everyone around me knows what they are doing and where they are going. \\n\\nI have always felt as if the whole universe is against me,  everything bad that could happen to me always seems to happen at once. it is the most unfair feeling in the world. \\n\\nI know I may come across as a sad sac of shit who is too lazy to go out and try new things, but I know I am not.Like now, I am feeling really depressed, I am looking through posts to try find anyone that is experiencing/having the same issues, but I can not find any. \\n\\n\\n\\nDoes anyone else struggle with this?Most days, if not every, I feel some semblance of my depression. I am constantly fighting to live, forcing myself to act, to move, to be. The sadness buries itself beneath a layer of confused muddled mush of feelings. And sometime, rarely, I cry. Like after listening to a song or watching something. But on the day to day, my feelings consist of dried out excuses for what could be real. I can not lie though, I do feel joy. I feel joy more than I am able to cry in fact. But the joy is just in the moments, fairly short lasting, and soon to be covered by the muddle of confusion which is my usual state. Every now and then, maybe two days - to one week a month, maybe twice a month, I do not keep track, I get worse. I go into deep depressions. Days where I can not force myself up. Days where my thoughts are haunted by negativity and where those feelings of muddled confusion manifest in self hate, these are the days like today. I always forget they come. And now I am here, in quarantine. With plenty to do, read, play piano, exercise, do school work, draw, write, watch tv, endless. Time, all I have is time. But the only thing that is calling my name is my bed. The only thing I ever want to do is sleep. And now that my thoughts have been cursed with these negative ones, thoughts of suicide and worthlessness -thoughts that always pass eventually, I have got the best excuse in the world to just fuck off and lay in bed, right?Have battled depression and addiction for decades, I feel I am losing now n see no light, I have two beautiful boys that I have not seen in a month now because of this b\\'s in the world, I feel broken n just want the pain to finally be gone, I want to turn my thoughts off, I have tried therapy multiple times n countless meds, it does not matter what it is nothing has ever brought me relief.a slice of cheese,\\nwater,\\nlays chips, \\nand toast,Anyone else feelin depressed and very anxious durin the day but when there is no more light outside you are more calm and peaceful?Hey guys,\\n\\nI have fostered dogs on and off for years and I have never had a tough time passing the dog on to it is new owner. But for some reason this last dog I had was just special. I have been caught in the worst depression I have ever had in my life and because of quarantine we were able to spend every second together for three weeks. Every day I would take him to the park and watch him play for a few hours, we would play together at home and snuggle in my bed. I was always sneaking him bits of my food. He was just such a good dog and I really wanted to adopt him but I can not because once I go back to work I will not have the time for him. He left yesterday and I cried all night just wanting him here so bad. I feel devastated. How can I get over this?\\n\\n[this is Beso](https://imgur.com/a/FBQkVT9)D = Down\\n\\nE = Exclusive\\n\\nP = \"Pathetic\"\\n\\nP = Pensive\\n\\nare = Rueful\\n\\nE = Emotional\\n\\nS = Sorrow\\n\\nS = Sarcastic\\n\\nI = In hatred\\n\\nO = Ongoing, when will it ever end?\\n\\nN  = Not finePeople used to comment on how I was such a good dad.\\n\\nI hope I can get it together before it is too late. \\n\\nI am very aware that the time is precious, but I just can not find the strength to make the most of it. I can not pull the pieces together to give guidance. I can not muster the energy to play and wrestle. I can not stop the gears from turning while we read and talk. I just can not get out.So i was diagnosed with depression not to long ago but I have felt I have had it for much longer but then my wonderful best friend said “you know maybe we could try this out” and then I felt so happy I came out to my parents too and they were super supportive and then my life just felt easier I still have depression I still have those days but my life just seems a little brighter now \\n\\nThanks for reading just thought I would share this to say there is always hope have a nice dayI am hitting a deadened and my stress level is up to the roof I failed in a subject and did not tell my dad and he want me to get straight A and I can not see a way out of this my depression and anxiety the one to blame for my F but no one would believe me my depression and anxiety would not go and I can not change it is just torture at this point. I have  thought about ending it but I still can not I am doomedI just want to get off this ride. I can not. I am bound to this suffering by the fear of worse suffering or worse; the suffering of others at my hand. So I press on, miserable, angry, hopeless, and wearing a smile to make sure that I do not disrupt the expectations. I am a lie... for your comfort.I struggle with depression, anxiety, my doctor thinks bipolar but I am not so sure. I have on my fourth concoction of medication (latuda & Wellbutrin) I am still depressed. \\nI understand pills are not a cure everything miracle but are not I supposed to feel better than this? I constantly think I would be better of dead, I am crying every few days, I have random panic attacks and am just overall sad and have little hope, low motivation, mental break downs sometimes suicidal thoughts. I have never felt any of these go away with any type of medication I have tried. What is supposed to happen? Am I expecting too much?My life has been such a pathetic failure that I do not even know what tf to do anymore. I am such a fucking ugly cunt that I do not even want to look at myself in the mirror. No matter what tf I do it just does not help at all. I have not had any friends since I left school and I do not even talk to my old ones anymore because I do not think they would ever care about my shitty problems. I wish this quarantine never ends because I do not want to ever have to show my ugly face to others.\\n\\nI have like 1 billion different bloody things going on in my mind that it just drives me crazy every single day. My parents do not give a shit about me and I have no one to go to. I just wished I was never born.\\n\\nSorry if you read this I just had to get this out of my mind.Its been like this for quite a while now. Things I used to be super excited about do not even interest me anymore. Everything feels like lost hope; like literal end of the world. It feels like no matter what I do, I have already messed everything up to the point of no return. \\nI do not feel like doing anything except sleeping it off.\\nBut I do not even know what \"it\" is! \\nEveryday trying to get even the simplest and minimal things done is a struggle. \\nAll the while this never ending big bag of guilt is on my shoulder. Guilt of not doing enough, not being enough. How do you get out of this? How do you not go further down the rabbit hole? \\n\\nwhat do you do?My greatest fear as a child was always being lonely. I have felt lonely all my life, even tho I had a few good friends throughout the years. Self harmed a bit, did whatever drugs I could get my hands on, and just tried to fit in with the people around me. But for some reason I just was never like them. Now I am 23 and I am as alone as I have ever been and my childhood fear has been realized. And I think I am still I am okay. I am think I am stronger than I anticipated. However it is so weird how the smallest things can send me tailspinning. \\n\\nIt snowed last night where I am. I made a Facebook post expressing my annoyance, as well did one of my friends. He got 12 likes, I got 2. Such a petty, nonsense reason to ruin my day. But it actually brought me to tears. that is so damn stupid because I know in my head that it does not matter. it is just fucking Facebook. It may just be that I am drunk tho. \\n\\nI hate that this seems to happen so often and that I struggle to get a grip sometimes. All I have ever wanted is to be happy but it seems the more I focus on that, the more I recognize that I am not. \\n\\nI am still hopeful I can turn this ship around someday so I am trying to keep my head up anyway that I can.

I am not a very social person I have been like this ever since I was a kid, for most of my life I did not have any friends. Even now I do not think I really have friends just acquaintances. No one ever asks about me, even my family stopped asking when someone contacts me it is usually because they want something from me or need me to do something for them. I am a collage drop out and been working dead beat jobs that I hate with a passion. I used to be in a relationship that lasted 3 years but the other person dumped me because I was boring and  their friends did not like me. I have pretty much gave up on dating and taking care of myself. I tried to reconnect with my family but they really do not care about how I feel they only care about what people think of me and not to ruin the family\\'s name so we do not really get along. My conversation with the family are very brief and always end in awkward silence. I have been spending most of time alone in my room and lost interest in everything. My days are a slow blurr because I do not do much. I used to spend most of my free time playing video games because they distracted me a bit from how much I hate my life. Things have gotten worse lately and I have been spending all my time outside of work rotting away in my bed. I do not ever remember myself crying but lately I have been crying everyday on the drive back from work and I have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and I am scared and do not know what to do.\\nI do not have any friends or family to talk to and I am piss broke and can not afford a tharapist. I tried to look for free help online but it usually leads to a person telling me to pray my thoughts away.As the title says. Just venting here. I have some honestly incredible friends who I can normally talk this through with, but the stars are aligning in all the worst ways and they are all in terrible places, going through much worse shit than me at the moment. Last thing they need to hear is someone else\\'s negativity right now. \\n\\nTo keep it simple, for the last eight nights, I have been having panic attacks whenever I settle for bed and then nightmares. it is literally come out of nowhere. I am no stranger to panic attacks, but I usually only get them in social situations, and nightmares have not really bothered me much before. I have not been able to sleep any more than three or fours hours each night, and on two nights, I have just given up and spent time on my computer mid-morning. \\n\\nI think it is just lots of little anxieties and worries building up, but the suddenness of it is floored me. I honestly do not know what to do. Been in touch with a doc about it via text (my university medical centre) and all I got back was a link to an online resource about improving your sleep hygiene. I guess the quarantine situation means I can not reasonably expect much on that front, which I understand and respect, but it still feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth. Country\\'s facing some nightmarish shit at the moment but having no medical guidance for it does not put any smiles on my face.\\n\\nI am trying not to fall into a self-pity hole, but I was honestly not doing *too* bad until I woke up today. I was feeling shit all week, but rolling out of bed and socialising at least one friend each day to keep myself distracted. Today, I immediately just felt like a lemming as I opened my eyes, like I want to just go hurl myself off a bridge. I have got friends in a Discord call right now who I could go join, but I feel so groggy and snappy that socialising is starting to feel like a worse and worse idea the more I think about it.\\n\\nI know it is just my brain being an utter dick to me plus my body crashing hard from the bad sleep, but I feel really stuck in this slump because of that. Any tips or advice you guys have would be appreciated. Thanks for reading, hope you are all holding up okay and staying safe with the world being as crazy as it is right now.Been laid off for just under a month now. \\n\\nI see on here a lot that a lot of people tend to isolate themselves anyways due to their depression. I have the opposite problem.\\n\\nI hang out with my family (My parents, grandma, and a couple cousins I am close with) and my boyfriend. I work 48 hours a week and on my off days I am usually with my boyfriend, at one of my parent\\'s house or at one of my two cousin\\'s houses.\\n\\nThis quarantine is making me crazy and I am starting to get really depressed. I was still hanging out with my boyfriend and parents since I have been laid off but now that the stay at home order (I live in Michigan) is starting to get more strict I have been trying to be more safe. \\n\\nMy parents last week told me they do not want me over anymore for a bit (which I understand). My boyfriend was over yesterday and I told him I do not want him over anymore for a bit (I do not really have a for sure time line right now, but probably until the stay at home order is no longer in effect) because he is still working. If he was not working I would not mind but he works with other people and I know he is not being as cautious as he should be (Not wearing mask and gloves). \\n\\nI live alone and do not really have any hobbies. All I have been doing when I am not with my parents is watching TV, reading, going for walks, and playing around on my phone. All of that stuff was getting boring anyways but I at least was able to break it up a bit by seeing my parents and having my boyfriend over. Now I can not do that so I am just going to be doing the same few boring things every day. I live alone too so I do not have anyone to talk to. \\n\\nI had the talk with my boyfriend Sunday and decided to have him stay over one more night (yesterday) and then no more for awhile. All I have done the last couple days is cry. All I think about is being alone the next few weeks. I feel like I am not going to make it. \\n\\nI am not really sure what I am looking for on this post. Just people to talk to, maybe support. Advice on things to do would probably be helpful too.Battling this sickness took everything. I do not remember but I think it is been that many that I have cried alone. No one listened. No one cared. I do not deserve this life. Even more so since I will be spending it all alone. I wish I was never born.I (15f) really need help. it is something I have been doing more and more over the past month or so, and I really need help to stop. Whenever I do it, I almost immediately reach out to my girlfriend (16f) and feel absolutely horrible, but it is what I deserve, so I keep doing it. I would keep doing it, but she blames herself, and I can not let her do that. I am hurting her, and she is the only thing keeping me going. I need to stop for her, because she has a history of self harm, has over 10 suicide attempts, and I am afraid she will fall back into that if I can not stop. \\n\\nPlease help me. I can not keep hurting her like thisHey everyone,  does anyone find that their mod is massively dictated by their energy levels? Like if you get bad sleep you have much stronger depressive thoughts?My father is emotionless and I inherited this from him. I always had problems with showing emotions especially sorrow. I can not cry. I cried during movie like twice in my entire life and one while playing videogame. I am feeling depressed often but I never talked about it because I always thought that I do not have right to be sad. I met some bad people when I was young and also my family kept me isolated so I developed social anxiety even tho I am extrovert. \\n\\nLast year I started trusting people again and made a lot of new friends, had a few short relationships and finally became who I naturally was. I was not depressed too often and I found people I can talk to about my feelings. I felt happy. Really happy after all those years.\\n\\nBut my government decided to put whole country in quarantine and closed schools, shops, everything. We are not allowed to go outside. I was supposed to see therapist for the first time, but government banned it before I could go.\\n\\nIt has been more than month in isolation.  My old anxiety came back and everyday I feel more and more depressed. Today I had mental breakdown. I feel like shit since I woke up and can not go outside or talk to anyone because I feel so ashamed of myself. I have a good family, lots of friends, nice home, good school, no one died and this quarantine is not forever. I do not think I deserve to be depressed, there is nothing too bad happening to me. Today I cried. I cried a lot and that is weird because I even thought that crying is impossible for me. I hyperventilated, vomited, almost passed out and cried more. \\n\\nStill feel ashamed. Still think I should not cry and feel bad because still think I do not have the right to do it.I am 16 and my parents absolutely refuse to let me get on any kind of medication even though my therapists advises it. i struggle immensely rn especially with suicidal thoughts and lack of motivation. does it really help that much? i just. idk i was my only hope n now that ny parents said no I have been thinking if it was even realistic to set those expectations for it. I know that I will still need therapy but therapy alone is kinda impossible rn when i have to take care of that myself n make sure i do not miss appointments and all that but can not do that while in such a major depressive episode.I was supposed to go in High School (or WTF you Americans call it) after Summer, and I was so excited because I would then get rid of the terrible raise hit people, that attend to the school, I am \"a part of\".\\n\\nAnd about 10-15min. ago, my mom told me \"Corona has Fucked up our economy, so you can not go to Hich School\" until now I have not smashed anything, or message someone I hate (by a name of another person) to meet up somewhere, and fuck him up.\\n\\ntho I am thinking about fucking up everything, and everyone, here comes what I want, the \"TIP\" what TF should I do?So got told this by my grandfather \"I am going to live longer then you\"I often been told that I have a good heart or that I am a good person but I often feel like it is not true. Yea I do alot of things to help people but I often feel like I am alone in the world. I been told why not get myself someone, I would often reply saying that I am not worth someone having. I been told to get over past traumas, I would reply that I try too but somethings never changes.\\n\\nMoral of the story is, I have what I need to be happy, yet I just feel utterally and totally useless and void of happiness.\\n\\nI became addicted to escapism to the point where the very concept of video games are being burnt out for me. Art is starting to not be fun for me, making music is starting to not be fun for me. Everything that I used to do for fun is being burnt out.\\n\\nThen there is the question of \"why not look for someone\". Simple answer, I am too mentally unstable for a relationship. It would take the worlds most patience person to understand and help me work through my problems without it affecting them. Plus I am terrible with people. \\n\\nWhen I was asked by I joined a league discord and joined a team and stuff, all I could say was. Because I was lonely. Not having people who wants to talk to you, or actually gives a shit about me for so long causes me to just be lonely.\\n\\nThe only thing in the world I want or per-say NEED in my life, are people who gives a shit and understands me as a person.it is one of those days I feel like my existence is just a burden to other people. As a distraction, I did this thing.. it is ugly and not the usual art I do, but it has so much of my emotions that I poured into it. It contains all the thoughts and phrases I always think abt or say when I feel like I am at a low point. But it did not seem to help me :( while I was doing it, I just felt like harming myself all the more right after I finish my art. So I realized this could be a potential suicide note.. I am really trying to stay strong at the moment though. \\n\\nSo yeah I just want to share what I did.. I hope it somehow helps those who feel the same way as I do that they are not alone. Here\\'s the link of what I did! please do not judge too hard hahaha\\n\\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1bD1VbGl-x9nUK-B1DMNki1e1F5cRD6tEI am 24, from poor country and poor family with alcoholic father. i currently share a room with my mom and sister. and there is no way out of that situation except for my fathers death, but even then i will not be able to move out and live on my own... not in this country with broken economy. and not with my education that ends on high school, because i was too depressed to do anything in school and i can not go to university to actually get any degree that couls guarantee me good job. i can not even pay any course... and i do not want to work like i currently am either.\\n\\nit all drives me crazy. i would probably commit if it were not for the fact that i do not even care about dying anymore. i just do not know what to do, I am lost and there is no one to help or support me or direct me in a proper way. i do not want to leave mom with that bastard either. chances of getting rid of him are 0, especially during pandemic. its just pathetic hoping that shit will get better, except it never did. not for as long as i live. \\n\\nall i want in life is to be able to afford living in bigger home and all my stupid whims like takeout or fencing lessons. i want to travel a lot too. and i wanted to study archeology - something that probably would grant me job with shit pay but i always wanted to do that. and because I am poor, because i can not afford anything, because of my pathetic life situation that is just the worst combination of unlucky events i can not do either and i know deep inside that i will always be stuck like this, in this ugly town and with no friends or even boyfriend (bc lol i never had either, not even one friend irl, no one even had a crush on me. hell, i could not go to school trips bc we could not afford them). i just... do not know anything anymoreI think I am depressed. \\n\\nA man I have deep feelings for and can grow to love does not love me. I heard he loved his girlfriend who I believe in return has been stringing him along only in the end to laugh in his face or turn him away, and not just because I am involved.  \\n\\nI do not have contact with him now but I will later. \\n\\nI feel as if while I am depressed, I can feel he will fall into depression and something is going to happen to him. 1 of 3 things. I have a feeling I am going to witness his death or otherwise. I will be telling his parents as they will learn we will not be around one another and cannot be around one another like this.I do not know how to explain it except for the fact that I love being outside. And now that I am constantly indoors with nothing to do but school work and review cold cases and all that, I feel trapped and depressed. Things I have not wanted to think about are constantly at the forefront of my mind and I can not get them to leave me alone. I can not sleep. I can barely eat. I feel alone in my group home and I feel like I can not get out. I just want to be outside, and being inside 24/7 is honestly making my depression worse. Has anyone been feeling the same and does anyone have any advice?Even the real fun days, the feeling always comes back. No one loves me, they say it but its an act. Everyone wakes up in the morning and puts on an act. I can not. I feel I do not have emotions because I do not know how to react to things anymore. (jokes, funerals, birth, parties, hanging  with friends) I have to think about how to react, its not natural. I hate my face. I hate my voice. I hate that when your nice its considered weak. I hate how the world works. I hate the racism, I hate the ignorance. I hate when your closest friends do and say the most hateful things about you behind your back.. or when they think you are not looking. I hate how evil this world is. People are so grimey and so greedy. The bad outweighs the good. it is backwards. My grandma died this year and I am completely empty and do not know what to do. I do not want to be here anymore.I have been diagnosed with depression for 3 years and I have only now thought of this. I really just do not understand why i can not as happy as the other kids.i created a throwaway account for this specific topic but i can feel myself spiralling and usually i used my razor as a distraction or something to numb the pain. i know i sound crazy but the same way drug addicts take drugs is the same way i inflict pain on myself. no one ever question addicts, and they all know what they do is dangerous. i treat my razor blade the same way, i know it is bad and i know it can kill me but i just do not care. i stopped close to a year ago but I have been going through some really shitty things and i feel like i need it againI am so sick of being stupid and deformedSeeiowaj whqy remwjj in fakaqb dyes, iqn a abwldu I canqq sdand in a aeokd I came steabq. Agamast I kwna slmw demons fownw theereal aoels Hell, Kufari iaa ghsfe...SATAN is there!Now that they stoped talking to me it is hell like it never was, i can not keep up with this quarantine and i want nobody else except those who have been always aroundI lost control over myself and once again picked up the hammer and unleashed all my anger. My anger towards myself. I sat down and let it all out on my leg. Now I am unable to get up again, unable to put any weight on my leg. Will this ever stop\\n\\nDue to corona I am currently on a break from therapy for depression, anxiety and BPD. I live alone, am alone at home 24/7 not doing anything all day. On Friday I made my only friend escape from our friendship. Since then no contact. I hit rock bottom and can not escape. The last days I spent crying and grieving for this friend. Hoping they would return. I kept reading posts that support my point of view, the Borderliner point of view. My emotions were mainly sadness, emptiness, yearning, grieving, hopelessness etc. Today random posts of other people showing the other point of view, my friends point of view, popped up. I lost myself in them. I read through all of them. \"I cut off a toxic friend and never felt more alive\" and similar posts. It triggered my anger. My anger and hate towards myself, until i lost it. I released it. Now the anger is gone and I am back to everything I felt before.I believe ugly people (including me) should have a choice to end their lives at no cost or punishment. Also, it would be beneficial to scan babies whilst in the womb, and terminate any that risk being ugly, for their own sake. This is why I have no qualms with designer babies, as there is no risk of genetic weakness or disease. This way, we can eradicate ugliness and there will be less needless suffering in the world, all because of luck.Throughout my struggles with depression I have had issue with the mentality that suicide is never the solution.  I would like to take this chance to voice my opion so I can hear what others think.\\n\\nBy saying suicide is never the solution is to imply that there is no amount of human suffering beyond which continued suffering is less humane than death.  I believe that such a point does exist and once past it suicide should not be discouraged.  Of course while you are suffering it is easy to think you are past that point when you are not so that determination can be quite difficult.  However difficulty of determination does not mean that point does not exist.\\n\\nAnyway, I curious to hear what others think.hey. I have been watching youtube a whole lot  \\nIt´s not the only thing I do, but I cannot motivate myself to do anything different while alone, I watch like 15 hours of youtube in a casual day. I´m 20 now ,and have been watching in similar manner since I was ten. I remember my older brother telling me to go and do something else, I did, simetimes, but I have allways returned to youtube as my source of \"fun\". I never talk to anyone, nobody wants to talk to me, nobody really knows how I spend my days, I feel like people do not like me, due to my life on youtube I am pretty akward as i have not expirienced many conversations in my latest life. Saying that, I do not have many friends in my home town, and even whan i meet with some people i find a lack of things to tell them. Are the people my friend when they never seem to want to talk to me? I don´t really know how to meet people, accept trough alcohol and drugs. I also can tell that my personality changes while talking to other people.  \\nhow can I be?Hey, how much is the lethat dose of insulin? My blood sugar is between 300 to 400no one gets it, the pain, the crying, the dark thoughts. it gets too much for me. everyone thinks \"you are lazy\" or \"you are not trying hard enough\". just because I do not have physical symptoms of being I will does not make it any less harder.this applies to me a lot, even if i do not realise it, i get attached easily attached to things, people, and ones that do not love me back. in a way i think i even love my depression too because what am i without it? an empty hole of nothingness i guessI have been hanging around this r/ for quite awhile. \\n\\nToday is a turning point, where I have lost the majority of my hope. It is now time to plan my next steps seriously. I pos this on the off chance my plan can provide someone guidance on the next steps of their life. And perhaps as an immutable record on the www. Maybe I am crying out to the world? Who knows?\\n\\nI have been fighting to repair things with my wife for months after another traumatic event, the passing of my mum. In a short span I have lost my wife, my mum, my home, my future, my dreams and soon my childhood home as my dad sells the place.\\n\\nI have done things wrong by my wife and was too ignorant and self absorbed to realise the signs. Even when she clearly pointed it out to me. I recognise its my fault now; I was too focused on what I thought she wanted and not what she told me she needed, and too lazy and dumb to carefully ponder her words. The best I can do now is to ensure that when I leave she is well cared for financially and that I have done all the things I have said I would to make her home perfect.\\n\\nAfter this I will give away the majority of my things; there is no meaning to collecting things without having a home to store them or someone to share them with. Years of work and money wasted hoarding things for a future that will never see the light of day. Alas, fate and hindsight be a fickle beast.\\n\\nFinally I will leave and volunteer in an impoverished nation to give someone a chance as happiness as penance for destroying my wife\\'s happiness. Maybe I will die here from crime or illness. But at least I will have made a positive impact on someone. Who knows I might feel like I deserve happiness again.\\n\\nWhat I will not do is leave without giving back to the world and balancing the scales. There is too much sadness in the world as it is. I have no hope for heaven but maybe this will absolve some of my sins.\\n\\nI know this is selfish to my family, but my sis has her partner and my dad will have my sister. Sometimes we have to do what will bring us peace be it momentary or eternal.\\n\\nI hope someone else find solace in the below excerpt of Dylan Thomas\\'s famous poetry. The complete poetry is not relevant to me but certain sections call out to my situation. It has given me and continues to give me strength in times of weakness, fighting for the courage to do good and remain hopeful as oppose to acting on my sucidal ideation.\\n\\n\"Though wise men at their end know dark is right,\\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\\n\\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\"I turned on the stove after leaving some chemicals on it and the bottle next to it, just hoping it would blow up or burn my face off. I do not know. It was idiotic but the impulse just happened. I think if I go up the stairs to sleep I might look back and try to throw myself down the stairs. At least I put all the knives away. I am tiredSo I am detoxing off of Pristiq with the help of my doctor. \\nI was on 100mg, then 75mg, then 50mg, then 25mg, then 25mg every other day. Now on day four of nothing and it is Hell. \\nFeeling everything. Was sitting in my lab at work yesterday, fighting back tears. I am not a crier. \\nCried last night for a good half hour. \\n\\nI know it is my brain chemistry readapting...but how long  it take?\\n\\nI am quitting them to see how I will feel without them and to be honest, I hate being on something that makes me dizzy if I miss a dose. \\n\\nAnyone else come off Pristiq after a long time on it?“You did not do this right” “you need to do more” “your being lazy” “you did not do this” \\n\\nIs it never enough?\\nI am done. I am done with it all and I am trying to keep it together, I am really am. there is always more I did not do, or should do. it is never enough. Just know I am not holding on for you. I want out. Out of this hellhole. If I did not have a best friend to disappoint, then I would be gone. I want to be enough, but you always see more.I do not know what to do and it is too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he is moving and we might not see each other again. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBackground of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he is been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can not really think of anything else right now, I am too sad about it).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI do not know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I do not know what else..I know where i am but i do not. Nothing feels real and it scares me. I am so scared. I know what happened but what if i do not deserve this? I do not deserve this this is too much i do not want to go back. This is too good for someone like me. I belong in the bad place. I belong there. Burning forever endless torture. I do not deserve this i do not deserve this oh god. There are people starving in other countries i do not deserve this please. I just want to be able to cry again. Nothing ever comes out.\\nI do not deserve to cry. How can i cry if there are people being tortured alive. How can i rest at t night if so many are suffering. Please let me sleep let me get away from this\\nI need to get out i need to get out oh god please\\nLet me out of this endless loop of abuse. I will not be like themHello, I have already tried a lot to find help but either people do not understand me or he does not seem to care.  I isolate myself because I feel like a burden.  No one really likes me because if I do not talk to them, they will not talk to me.  But sometimes I feel lonely but really and I start to have paranoid delusions in these situations.  I have never seen a psychologist.  I am a lost because and no one is concerned about my mental health or how I am going.As soon as I seek help I feel worse.  Like I want to live like this all my life.  When I am in the mood I feel bad because I did not get used to it.  My friends must have hurt with this.  There are those who keep telling me that I have several personalities (I don\\'tthink so), but then on this kind of thing I think about it all night.  Or some people tell me that I am too skinny.  I do not understand why people care so much about people\\'s bodies but not about their problems.  I am fed up. So I would like to leave to stop living in all this suffering, so that people can notice that I existed.I have been taking birth control pills and it screwed me so bad, i cut myself, i think of death and several ways to do it on daily basis, i can not stop taking the birth control pills, i take them not to sleep with someone, I am sick and the doc told me to take them, it is so tiring, i do not want to shower, or look nice or anything, all i want is peace of mind, and i do not remember the last time i had that, i miss enjoying stuff, i want to read a book but i just can not because all the thoughts comes and i start thinking of how worthless i am, I am in great pain, and i do not have anyone i could rely on, i do not trust people, i have casual friends but i can not tell them anything...\\nit is really hard to be alive.My (23f) job went remote 6 weeks ago. It was the only social contact I had. My coworkers and I were not friends, but I was around people and did not just stare at the wall all day. I miss hearing other people\\'s voices so much. \\n\\nI live with my parents and we have a terrible relationship that makes me extremely lonely. My mom has slight agoraphobia so I was forced to stay inside my entire childhood. I am getting triggered and am intensely lonely.\\n\\nI have always used tinder but now have been using it obsessively. I am not attractive but am photogenic. I got out of an abusive relationship this past year which has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I am extremely self-conscious. \\n\\nI started talking to this one guy for a while through text/phone calls. He asked to videochat and I said \"I feel like you are not going to like me once you see me out of pictures.\" (I had been snapchatting him and he definitely got pictures of my body. So he was aware of what my body looked like). But I am carrying a lot of face weight that is not shown in selfies and I have some acne and indents (which he knew about too). \\n\\nHe assured me it would not be an issue and he wanted to make me feel good about myself. He said we were a great fit emotionally and sexually (sexting). He found me attractive. So I agreed.\\n\\nWe videochatted and it went well. I enjoyed it and actually liked him more. Well, low and behold, he is instantly not into me anymore. I asked why and he would not give me a reason even when I pressed. So naturally, we know what it is.\\n\\nThat gutted me. \\n\\nHe was SO into me before. And then it instantly switched off for him.\\n\\nNow my brain is going a million miles a minute. it is telling me that my abusive relationship was the best one I will ever have. Which I have always believed. I mean honestly, that man is the only one who loved me for me. He cared about me more than my parents. He was my only friend for the last three years. I called him and asked to get back together. He said no.\\n\\nI know I need to lose so much weight and get botox and make major improvements to my physical appearance in order to have anyone even consider liking me. But I also know that is not possible. I am never going to lose this weight and I just do not have the money.\\n\\nSo now my brain is telling me I have to get used to the fact that I will never have a boyfriend again, which means no husband/kids. I have never been successful with making friends. I am trying to accept the fact that I will always be completely alone. And I just wish I could. I have been crying nonstop since Sunday. \\n\\nAnd I am expected to work through all of this. I am expected to be more productive than usual in order to keep my job. I literally can not even keep myself alive.\\n\\nSorry for the rant. I am just so fucking lonely.Any tips? I have realized and accepted that nostalgia is killing me. Killing my dreams, moments, and I always am trying to recreate the past in many ways. it is unhealthy and as much as I feel comfortable in what I know, it is not helping me get anywhere not helping me with my depression. Any tips on how to overcome this?I do not know if I suffer from depression now, but I have previously been diagnosed, and I find it very difficult to just sit down and read a book. it is partly because of the silence: I do not want to feel alone and with my own thoughts and so I prefer to sit on my laptop with videos of others or with music. I would like to get through some books I have been meaning to read for a long time now that I have a little bit of extra time, but I just can not make myself focus. I can not get beyond a couple of pages before getting up and doing something else. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHas anyone found any tricks to help them focus?I will wake up and be blissfully unaware of all life’s bullshit for about a minute, then slowly my heart sinks as I remember every fucked up thing I am dealing with and I want to sink back into bed forever. Every morning. Literally did not get up 2 days last week. I am so tired of this.So personally, sometimes when I am depressed as shit. My limbs feel very heavy and i struggle to move them, I am guessing this is a mental thing that affects energy but anyway, hope you all can have a ok day/night and thanks for reading whatever this is.TLDR: prolonged suicidal thoughts on my “bad” days, how do I stop from thinking about it too much?\\n\\nTo provide some background, I (34F) was sexually abused by my parents since I was 10 (continued until I was around 26, when I cut them off) and I was bullied during elementary school. Everyone always told me I am too pessimistic, too negative, and cry too much. I suspected I had depression but never had psychiatric exams. Even when I was in elementary school, I had some thoughts like “I will not have to be worried/scared/sad anymore if I die.” \\n\\nI went NC with my parents about 8 years ago, which is when I first met my husband (my then first boyfriend). My husband made me realize that my parents are toxic.  it is interesting how I thought my parents were loving, good, “model” parents back then. The crazy thing is I still miss them sometimes.\\n\\nThings got better after a while, I have a decent job that pays well and just bought a house this year. Despite all these “positives”, I still fantasize about sleeping forever or not exiting in this world. This especially happens when I have arguments with my husband. I guess you could say the only positive existence in my life is my husband (and my dog).\\n\\nWhenever I “fight” with my husband, even though they are all small arguments, I feel like the world is not worth living and I constantly find myself looking up ways to end my life. I spend hours (usually for 3-8 hours at a time) reading about various methods of suicide that have/have not been successful. It came close the other day, when I was testing a belt on a wall hook to see if I could hang there for at least 10 mins without falling. But then I remembered reading about how hung corpses are gruesome and it will traumatize whoever finds the corpse, and I did not want my husband/dog going through that. \\n\\nI went to various therapists and psychiatrist before and they have not been that helpful. I am tired of talking about my past at this point. I am tired of crying. Husband still wants me to give it another try, possibly get on depression meds. Last time I took Zoloft, it did not seem to really help, but I can not tell for sure since the doctor prescribed me a “pediatric” dose (I am small).\\n\\nHow do I stop dwelling on suicidal thoughts? The world does not seem that great and if it was not for my husband, I would probably just die. \\n\\nSorry for the disorganized story and format, I did not sleep last night and I am typing on a phone. Thanks for anyone who bothered reading this.Hello, \\n\\nI have never really been the type to be Depressed, I have always been a very optimistic and confident  guy. As of late with this whole Coronavirus pandemic i have been feeling the loss of interest in participating in society and maybe even being alive. This really spans from me being a classified an essential employee at a t-mobile store. I am thankful to be able to have a job because I know it is much better than not having one and I personally am taking the right precautions to stay safe.\\n\\nHowever since my store reopened, most of the types of customers i have been seeing are people breaking quarantine because the are simply bored and want to be out and about. the question we get the most is  \"what kinds of deals do you guys have?\" \\n\\nThis infuriates me because someone can just as easily look this up online without putting themselves or my co workers and I in danger. and for as long as there are people like that i do not see the situation getting any better.\\n\\nI have also seen the better air quality and have read articles here and there about the atmosphere actually healing from the reduction of human activity.\\n\\nMaybe humans are parasites despite our perceptions of ourselves. We are the only species that take and never give. we are literal maggots to this rotting earth. the more turmoil we go though, the less will i have to live. i feel like there is no point to anything at all. and i have never felt as suicidal as i do in these timesI am so tired. i sincerely hope there is no afterlife. i just want dreamless sleep. eternal oblivion or whatever.\\n\\neveryone tells me not to... but they do not know. they do not know how exhausting it is to wake up like this. they have fun, they go on dates, they enjoy life without this curse.\\n\\nwhat would they even do if i did? they could not do anything. because id just be dead. ugh\\n\\nbut i will not. because i know it would hurt them a lot worse than it would hurt me. and in the end this is not a pain i wish on any one of my friends. i love them, so I will stay alive for now. even if it sucks and i just want to scream at the sky and just not e x i. s t anymore. \\n\\nI will stay alive so they do not have to scream at the sky like i do. I will stay alive so they do not have to rant about how much they want to die on r/depression like i do. \\n\\nand they will not thank me for it. and they will never know I am only staying alive for them, and that is okay. maybe one day i can thank them for being my reason not to give up, but today is not that day. because today, its 9am, the sun is shimmering, birds are out, and i have never wanted to kill myself more.During and right after a therapy session, I feel connected to my therapist and positive about my CBT exercises for the week.\\n\\nAs the week goes by and my next session approaches, I feel more and more pessimistic about my therapy regime, struggle to do my CBT exercises and feel like I have not spoken to my therapist in months...\\n\\nDoes anyone else struggle with this or has anyone stopped going to therapy because of it? How do you deal with it?I have been suffering with depression ever since I was 9 and eventually developed PTSD from childhood trauma and neglect and mental abuse to the point where I legit do not know how to make any friends what so ever. I am always alone.. I never get asked to go anywhere.. no one thinks of me.. I always spend my birthdays alone.. holidays are depressing.. etc. this pandemic is not helping me feel any better but it is not like I was even doing anything with my life before this .. I do wish I could just disappear and start a new life somewhere with amazing people who want to be successful artist like me someday.. 😔 but I just know it will never happen and I get even more depressed knowing I will forever feel this void and emptiness that’ll never be filled.. I really just hate everything 😔 tired of having no home as well. Tired of having to constantly move and I gave up so badly to the point I have not even unboxed any of my things for two years now... sigh 😔I am really struggling right now and need some help. \\n\\nOn the outside people think I have it good, because I have a wife, 2 kids, a house and a reasonable low end job, but I go through periods of feeling really down. Like a lot of people due to the virus I have been furloughed since the lock down and do not know if I will have a job to go back to after the lock down is lifted. it is stressing me out. \\n\\nI have been in the house for 3 weeks just me and kids because my wife is a key worker. Now, I love my kids but I am not the stay at home type. I have always been the strict parent with a short fuse and my patience has been worn away to nothing. I find myself shouting at my kids and wife. I hate it. It makes me feel worthless that I can not even be nice to my family.\\n\\nI grew up with a family that has strict ideas of what a man should do and be so I have never really able to manage my emotions. I just stuffed them down until they burst over. I struggle to talk to people even at the best of times, never at the worst. \\n\\nI know this is a bit of a ramble and I apologise but can anyone suggest anything to help everything stop weighing so much? I need to drag myself up because this can not go on.Every time I play ps4 with my mates I am the one getting bullied. it is always me. They make fun of me, insult me and then decide to kick me from the party. We are all friends but I always wonder why it is me who is always the butt of everyone’s jokes. Yeah, sometimes they are funny but it gets to the point where I consider leaving them. One of my friends likes to say that I am at the bottom of the food chain and that is why I am always getting teased. How do I get myself out of the bottom and stop getting teased. Why is it people like me that get picked on. Why does nobody help. I do not understandI am not sure how to explain this well but I will try as best as I can. \\nAll my life, I have experienced this feeling of confusion, dumbness and brain fog. Since I was a kid, I have experienced major anxiety and depression and I wonder if this has a lot to do with it? I have always had a HUGE problem not being able to learn anything at school. Being in an environment with so many others allowed my anxiety to almost completely numb my brain out.  \\nMy anxiety and stress got so bad in middle school that I developed psychosis (possible schizophrenia) for 3 years and I never told anyone about it. It really physically felt like my brain was changing form or melting.\\nIn college, it was all the same. I am 21 now, and it is as if my confusion and IQ worsened so much. I could not learn anything, including basic knowledge. When people would talk to me I could not process it-I can not even say a proper sentence correctly without pausing as I speak and having to try my hardest to word it correctly. I made so many unbelievably stupid mistakes, I became so forgetful and my movements slowed. I do not think I will ever be able to be successful at school or learn how to drive a car. there is no motivation for me to make a plan for my future or maintain my hygiene. I do not know what to do. I am really convinced that my brain may be rotting. My brain always becomes confused and then starts to ache really bad like it is shutting down. I feel like dying because I do not think I can ever be cured from something like this. it is actually like my mind is dying and disintegrating as I am still alive. Am I even making sense? I have never been vocal about this-I will accept any insight and advice on this, please.Just last night. In a horrible way and did not get to say goodbye. He was my everything. I have nothing more to live forMy (23f) closest friend (21f) has revealed to me that she is depressed, does not have the energy to eat & feels the weight of the world on her shoulders. She really does have a lot on her plate, a narcissistic creep of a dad, a lazy alcoholic mother that has seemed to have resigned from motherly duties (they have recently seperated & she lives w/ her mother) many animals (birds, horses, dogs) to feed everyday, a younger brother to look after & a boyfriend that does sweet fuck all to help or support her.   \\nShe is not the type to feel helped/supported by advice, so how can i help? is there anything i can say to make her feel better? She is not very affectionate either.   \\nThe help that i feel comfortable giving her is not the type of help that she would really appreciate & i am worried. i do not know what to do... i want to be more adequate when it comes to dealing with mental health & i love my friend :( i do not know what to do guys, please any advice would be so appreciated.I have just enough motivation to do a hobby. (s/o to wellbutrin)\\n\\nCreative things are my default. But when I try different ones, they all feel equally unappealing.\\n\\nSo how do you tell what is worth pursuing?\\n\\n(It does not help that I am shit at them. I feel embarrassed because everyone I know doing similar things started 5+ years ago, and is not shit at them. If I try to have a conversation about it, I am going to sound like an idiot. Half of my motivation is to have something to talk about so I do not seem so boring. So it feels pretty pointless.\\n\\nI have been told by therapists to think about what I liked as a kid \\'before\\' I was depressed, but that is obviously a dead end.\\n\\nI know I like cooking. But there is only so much cooking I can (afford to) do in a day. None of the things I try feel anywhere near as satisfying. But even my interest in that has gone down recently.)yesterday i opened up a little to my parents, and now they have locked all the doors and took the keys. I am scared of my parents for what they will come up with next. i do not want to be here anymoreSo, I am finally reaching out to someone, other than my 2 friends who are not very helpful in that respect. Its been going on for around 5\\\\~6 years \\\\[i do not remember what year i was in at that time\\\\], my life is going to shit, i think about >!killing!< myself almost daily. As i already said, i have not really spoken to anyone about this and i felt that now would be a good time to do so. The school does not do shit about the bullying, or anything that can lead up to this. i did not think much of it at first, just thought it was normal sadness. But it did not go away. It was there, and it still is. I have the odd happy day, but even then its ruined. It feels like I am falling, and with every day I am hitting something on the way down, climbing again, and then falling further. I want to feel normal again, i want to stop being used for \\'therapy\\', and i just want to be left alone once in a while. I came here so i could get this off my chest, because its starting to overwhelm me. I use humour to cope, but all the people i use this with tell me I am not funny and that i should stop trying to be. i get put down for bringing up anything I am proud of, or anything i feel worried about. I am close to ending it, but i do not want to let down anyone who truly does care about me, but at this point there is only around 3 people i know of. I am pretty much done with life, done with the people in it, and done with myself. I am sick of feeling like this, because its starting to impact my physical health, and i do not have motivation to do anything. I have tried to find something to do with my time, but nothing works. i just want to be a new person, or just disappear.Listen ladies and gentleman I need some people to talk to. I am not going to go into great detail but I have been completely in love with this girl for probably the past 4 years but 3 years seriously. There are so so many intricacies right the story but let us just say I have spent days upon days in time ruminating of being with her of our memories and our future and how I was the Happiest and most driven I have ever been with her. I am a pretty emotional guy I guess but the amount of nights of sleep I have lost over this girl is astronomical, I have gone for runs at midnight bawling my eyes out just and bawled my eyes out so so many times. \\n\\nI am a good looking guy in very good shape (not bragging) and I like to think I am a very good person but anyways I cannot live anyone and I also do not know how to put myself out there as I am not super social to strangers and I put myself into introversion more often than not even though I have good social skills. She is dating my friend and has been for about a year and anyways I have times where I forget she exists but then I see her friend or her name somewhere and I am put into a heart wrenching “depression” I guess and I do not know what the fuck to do, all my dreams and goals seem pointless if I can not share them with her. I can still remember vividly her telling me she did not love me like I loved her and processing to throw up in the toilet instantly after no joke. I can not do this anymore people I can notI have been depressed for most of my life, I used to constantly talk to my friends about my issues. But recently I have learned that nobody actually cares, and no advice ever helps. Opening up about it does not make me feel better, it makes me feel stupid. I just feel stupid and weak for being like this, so since it has no point I have just stopped talking about it. And on the flip side they stopped asking how I have been. I have got a few “glad you have cheered up a little bit” and “good to see you are good” and such. I am not actually better, I have not been this bad in a while. Been going through a rough period for a few months now. Ending it is not an optional, and I hope I can improve my situation after all this virus stuff passes. But it is just a pointless hope, my life’s not getting any better. I am still going to be the same fat loser until I die alone in my 30’s. But hey at least I do not got to deal with the constant bullshit from people who do not actually give a shit about Me. And I do not have to do the stupid song and dance of being vulnerable and accepting shitty advice from people. Now I can just bottle it all up in silence and not have to deal with others “worrying” about me.So I have been talking to this girl (I am a guy) from a subreddit for making new friends since february. At first we were just friendly, wed talk about anything and everything. There was a girl i liked at work and since i did not really have any close female friends at the time there was no one to ask for advice/talk about it with. So i talked about it with this girl. But then this girl got back with her ex, which i kinda saw coming. But especially since quarantine me and this reddit girl have talked a lot. I hypothetically asked her out to which she said yeah. And so i confirmed that if i actually came to hers after quarantine and asked her out she would say yes, and she said yes. So there is that. \\n\\nSince then we been talking about everything and more. The last week we have been calling each other and sending each other nudes. Which we would joke about a few weeks back. Like id say \\'send nudes\\' and she would say \\'bet\\', then id say \\'jkes\\' and then \\'unless you want to\\'. Basically i have fallen for this girl hard we have even been on dates in games. I have tried to figure out if she is serious, like am i just being played. But everything seems to check out. Like she sent nudes and stuff and we call. But yet i can not help but feel like it could still be a massive troll. Like she knows I am not talking to anyone else and stuff as she would say \\'i do not have side hoes\\', she says she does not and i 98% believe her. But obviously until we meet there is going to be doubt. But it could literally be months before we get to meet. I am treading on dangerous water. Because if this is not all it seems to be I am going to have a big fuckin problem so i hope to fuckin god this is real.Well, here I am.\\n\\n  I do not know where to begin. Life has been pretty rough lately, it has been for everyone. I have been working as much as possible so I do not lose my mind with everything that has happened within the past two months. The best conclusion I can currently come up with to make myself feel better is plan for the future. We hope (my household), with our stimulus checks, we can move out of the motel we are currently living in. Since I am also still working and receiving a paycheck, I intend to use this money towards fixing my teeth and getting a phone. I intend to help my best friend get her license and a car in the both of our names. Eventually, we are going to move out of state together. We can not figure out where yet, but that does not matter. we are making goals and we are planning and we are working and waiting. that is all we can do, right now.\\n\\n On a sadder note, I am learning to not cry as often. Which does not sound sadder, by any means. But I kind of feel like it could be. Numb has always been worse because it just makes the days go faster, it does not take away that looming sense of doom in the back of my head. Or take your face away when I close my eyes. do not get me wrong, I know I will be okay. I just need to listen to \\'I see a light\\' by Hank Williams on repeat and keep reminding myself what I need to do. If the harsh things I have been through have taught me anything, it is to learn to love and let go. And the best way I know how right now, is to just hope that someday, you will be proud of me. That also keeps me going a little bit. that is what helps me accept what has happened. Instead of convincing myself I am horrible and letting myself rot in my own little she will like I have so many times in the past before, once I started to, it woke me up. I saw myself in the mirror last week and I hated what I saw. So, if anything, you will be proud of me someday, just like I will be.it can not be just me. i come to this sub for moral support when I am really struggling and i need to relate to somebody, i do not need to see “it will get better!! stay alive!! talk to a professional! CaLL tHe SuIcIdE hOtLiNe!!” \\n\\nfuck you. i do not want to hear it. i love seeing recovery stories, but i do not like it when the person telling the story starts trying to give us a pep talk. and i ESPECIALLY do not want to hear it from a neurotypical when I am sobbing at four am and trying to stop thinking about my x-acto.I do not have a reason to live anymore. My life has just gone downhill for a long time now and i can not find an anwser. I am to scared to tell others because i think they will stop looking at me the same way they do now. Pls helpHOW DO I UNINSTALL THIS LIFE OF MINE ? ? ?I struggle go get out of bed and fulfill my basic needs. I am even lucky i still got my job, hence I have used almost everyday to sneak away isolating in my car to the point where collagues come to ask me if I am okay. I guess that is what is my underlying intention. I feel like nobody cares and I am all alone. I even self harmed at work several times.\\n I feel so deeply ashamed of myself. Someome came to my car again today and I want to just drive off som cliff or something.  I hate myself. I deserve to be in pain. Not even trying to feel better.I am 15 and i have it fairly good, upper middle class family, considered to be \"popular\" school, do well acedemically but I am still so fuckin depressed. when people ask me how I am doing i can not tell them I am doing shitty because i do not a reason to be doing shitty so i always just tell them that I am doing fine. about a 2 months ago i was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and put on antidepressants but they do not help i still hate myself and life. really the only people that are there for me are my close friends and if I am honest their the only reason I am alive. I have started drinking/smoking/vaping/drugs to try and numb the pain cus i promised them i would not hurt myself anymore. its jus like every fuckin day i reach my breaking point. I have tried to find healthier ways to cope but nothing numbs it like getting high. i jus found this sub and idk why but i thought maybe it would help to make a post, sorry for the wall of text to anyone that reads this.I have depression because of failed relationship with one girl. Funny, i know, but this shit happens with me.\\nShe is completely lonely person, she does not have friends. Other people in our group laughed at her, they see her as selfish, stupid person. I defended her all the time, though she did not know anything about it. She had a depression, i wanted to help her, cheer her up, and suddenly felt in love. When my attempts to start relationship failed i used tactic proposed by my psychologist - write an letter, where you can write about your feelings and ask for help. I did it. I did not want relationship with her anymore, but i wanted to talk. But she ignored me. Ignored, ignored and ignored.\\nA couple of month have passed. This time was terrible for me. I told the story to my friend, and she told me, that maybe you can write her now,  start Just friendly conversation. And she ignored me again. Yeasterday i was so angry because of this, that i write \"i hate you\", because i really hated her because of doing that with me. She ignored.\\nYeasterday\\'s evening i stalked her twitter - a horrible misstake.\\n\"that dumbass classmate writes me again. I almost commited suicide this February, and he wrote me fucking essay about how terrible his life is and now he is offened because i did not cheered him up and did not wipe away his tears. Go to the doctor, you bumbass, its better than living with illusions about girlfriend\"\\n\"I am fucking shaking because of this story, i deleded the conversation story. Maybe he will write a book for me. The most terrible thing is that he knows where i live\"\\nI had depression since 2018, i almost commited suicide in november 2019. I went to the psychologist. I was THE ONLY person, who  treated her like a real human beign. I reallied loved her. My friend, that told me to write her, told, that she was shocked, and she was always that person, which i see now.\\nI do not know what to think about. I feel like a shit. I am so confused. No one never insulted me like that.\\nI feel guilty right now. Guilty of writing her, guilty of cheering her up, guilty of sending her that fucking letter, in which I asked for help.  Why?  Why is it so Hard, even knowing what a shit she is. My friends support me of course, but they are my friends. now i want either me or her commit fucking suicide. I want  her to fucking now all the truth about me defending her from our classmates. I want her to remember the evening, when I took her criing home.  I want to spread across the Internet the disgusting  nude photo of hers i found in her twitter, i want her fucking kill herself.\\nSo, what should i do to calm myself? I can\\' attend psychologist due to that shity virus. Please, tell meMy depression has been progressively getting worse over the last 2 years to the point where my physical health is severely being affected. I found a therapist that I really got along with and we had started the process of possibly starting me on medication. Then what really felt like overnight I was confined to my house No school No job No therapy. Everything feels like it is been put on pause and I am not sure I am able to survive a pause. I do understand the circumstances of the pandemic far outweigh the discomforts I feel at home what can I do though ? I can still contact my therapist but since it is done through my university they have set up a ‘call in as needed’ system and with my family around the house there is not much room for privacy. Medication has to be placed entirely on hold being unable to leave the house and I am not sure if at the moment that is an allowable necessity. And routine feels unattainable, I am too anxious at night to sleep then sleep all day and I can not tell if I am consciously avoiding meals or not but either way I eat a lot less. Lack of basic self care is not new but a month ago I felt like I was doing the right things to fix that and now I just feel lost.I have been with my bf for a year and half. Lately my best friend left me, which made my bf the only person I can rely on and talk about hard feelings coming from depression. The worst part of me is having mental breakdowns regularly - when this happens, I cry with no reason for a long time and need some gentle support.\\n\\nSo yesterday night the breakdown came and I could not fall asleep till 5AM. When I told my bf in the morning about my trouble night he got frustrated. He asked me if I ever think about him doing such things - by that he meant not sleeping, crying and feeling depressed. \\n\\nHe also told me that I am giving up and do nothing do fight the depression. Yeah, I can not do much at the time - due to pandemics I cannot go to therapy. I also feel so senseless that any fight is not worth effort for me, to be honest.\\n\\nSo due to his frustration I promised him to pretend that everything is fine. This thing gives me many difficult feelings, like the feeling that I will not longer be able to be my true self to him. Or the feeling that I have lost the only person I could rely on hard times.Depression is all consuming, for me I feel it before my first thought when I wake up. Depression is very good at exploiting vulnerabilities and eroding your strengths. It really tires you physically and mentally because all you are doing is putting all your energy towards just trying to be normal. It feels like you are in a world of your own, disconnected from reality, where everything going round you is on mute.\\n\\nI am always finding ways to escape this constant feeling of sadness, but it always catches up. Sometimes you have the will to fight it, but when everything you try and do fails or makes things worse, I reluctantly start to thing it is best to do nothing. But doing nothing does not help either. There is no winning.\\n\\nIt has come to a point where when I see happiness from something as simple as enjoying an ice-cream to joy from affection, I am jealous of it. Jealous and sad because I know I cannot feel that happiness. \\n\\nI am full of pain and darkness.Just as context, I have been diagnosed with MDD since I was 14. I did not start taking treatment seriously until I was 20. This year I turn 22. My psychiatrist explained to me that because I had gone for so long without treatment, my brain has essentially rewired itself to insufficiently process reward chemicals, and that I would need to take medication for potentially multiple years before going back to normal. She said that, perhaps, I never could go back to normal.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is been so long that \"normal\" for me feels like being depressed.\\n\\nIt took time for me to experiment around with different medications and dosages until I found the pairing that really helped (Welbutrin 300mg and Zoloft 100mg if you are curious.) When I start taking the medication, I start feeling great after about a month. That terrible feeling in my chest is gone. My suicidal thoughts are suppressed. It feels like I can actually talk to other people.\\n\\nBut every time... after about 3 months or so, I start feeling like I am not myself anymore. I feel like the medication took apart of me away. Almost like being depressed is a part of who I am. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they told me I am stupid for feeling that way. Am I actually stupid? Am I alone in this feeling?\\n\\nIt feels cathartic to be depressed and to cry and cut myself. Everytime I start up my medication, i have to resist the urge to stop. Before I would started taking again, I told my psychiatrist how I felt, and all she said was that I need to fight the urge to stop. She explain that the more times I stop and start the medication, the less effective it will be the next time. And if I keep this cycle up, I may because irreparable damage to my brain\\'s reward system.\\n\\nI am fighting the urge again. I am starting to miss feeling hopeless and miserable. And in a way, I feel hopeless and miserable not feeling that way anymore.\\n\\nSorry my only question really is, if anyone reading this has gone through phases like this? Maybe my friends are right and I am just stupid.i hope i die soonI do not belong here; I do not belong anywhere.\\n\\nI can not accept the fact that this is ILLNESS. it is ME (but maybe I am poison, selfish illness making my loved ones suffer.) I relate to people there so much, but.. it feels more like \\'people of the same personality, interest, point of view on life and everything, experiences...\\' I know it is objectively not true, and it is probably healthy to accept the fact it is illness. But any time I read \\'depression, the mental illness\\' it makes me UNCOMFORTABLE (and writing it like this is the same).\\n\\nI do not know, am I the ONLY one feeling/thinking this way? (that is probably all I want to know.) Anyway thank you for reading. Sorry for wasting your time (if I did not I am glad) and hope you have a better day.So I am in a weird situation where I do not want to get out of my depression. What if I actually enjoy life and somehow it is cut short. That means I am actually going to miss it during my final moments. But by being depressed I can die anytime without feeling any regrets or sadness. Does anyone feel this way or is it just me?Last year i was prescribed trazodone i read and heard good stuff about it , until when i tried it i got a bad case of stuffed nose that made my anxiety worse.I like t know if most other antidepressants got histamine and if i might get the same side effect.So I can not partake in any recreational drug use due to my job and I do not drink alcohol due to migraines. But literally all my friends and husband are pot heads. It gets really frustrating when I have to sit here and watch them not deal with stress or reality sometimes. do not get me wrong I am grateful that they are not depressed or anything and believe me some of them would totally be without it. But there is a jealous/ angry side of me that gets upset. Especially because it feel even more isolating when you feel like your surrounded by people who are not even living in the same reality as you or are neglecting to accept reality because they are just high for 98% of it. And I am just stuck in this bubble dealing with all alone completely sober with nothing but my own mind and will power carrying me through.Every day, it gets harder and harder to find the will to live. \\nI need more and more coffee in the morning to function because I do not find inner strength. \\nI am completely out of assets. I am usually upset about my appearance but I do not have anything actually. \\nNo personality, brains or connections. Just a piece of meat floating and consuming food.\\n\\nTime for my glutes exercises. Though who am I lying to, my ass will never be a match to IG girls.I have been broken for a year, i do not know how to heal. I can not stop thinking about him and its tormenting me\\n\\nwhy am i still dying after almost a year\\nwhy can not this be over already \\nFuck me i do not want to bear anymore of itAnd it was a hug. From someone who stopped talking to me and forgot I exist. FuckI do not want to die. I have had the thought. Planned it over. A suicide murder. I have planned the blood splatters. The looks on people\\'s faces. Is cutting or threatening my life the only way SOMEONE will take me seriously?! Is being a mental TEENAGER so unbelievable due to hormones that I should have to THREATEN MY LIFE for people to TAKE ME SERIOUSLY. I have heard the same thing over and over. it is normal. A lot of people do that. You do not have that. The only way therapy is paid by insurance is if a doctor recommends it. If I told a doctor everything I would be sent to a mental hospital. But because I am emotionally dependent, I surrounded my self around a person who is also emotionally dependent on me. So if I leave she would probably die. And everyone keeps BUGGING me about school. I know I have work. I get panic attacks when I think about it let alone try and do it. I can not THINK about algebra when I am having a panic attack.\\n\\nI have been told I do not need medication by a school assigned councler. Maybe I do not because I am already going numb emotionally. Maybe when I am finally 18 I will get help. What if I am unhelpable by then. What do I have to do for people to take me seriously. Do I have to threaten my life just to have a professional that I can talk to. One that one immediately judge me, or say it is normal. One that will know what to ask and how to handle serten things. Is that to much to ask?! Because for some reason the smallest amount of money can not be spared for online therapy but $50+ dollars on door dash McDonald\\'s is fine.\\n\\nI am so done. I am. Done with people giving me the same thing over and over. And I am done with seeing other posts that are simple \\'i do not like my meds any more.\\' And they get HUNDREDS of likes and over 50 replies. What do I get?! 7 likes, 5 dislikes and 2 comments, one of them my own. No matter where I go the adults with NOTHING to complain about get more attention then me. NO ONE CARES THAT YOUR TIRED OF YOUR MEDS AND THERAPY AT LEAST PEOPLE CARE ENOUGH TO TRY AND HELP.I am 21 (f). The last time I cut myself was January 2019 after my ex called me, crying and begging me to stop when I told him I did it again. I promised I would stop. I was admitted to a clinic after I tried to drown myself directly after that. Things were fine. My ex and I eventually broke up after everything we battled through. it is been 6 months since then. I feel like my life is going downhill. People feel like shit around me. I have zero motivation to do anything. I am constantly angry and moody. My parents make me feel like I am never enough. Like I do not contribute anything. And they are probably right. I just can not cope anymore. This lockdown is making everything so much worse. I just feel worthless and I hate myself. I have tried everything. Writing. Drawing. Cleaning. Cooking. Habit tracking. Nothing is helping.Okay, so i just want someone answer me am i depressed?\\n\\nI hate saying, that everytime i am sad that means i am depressed. I never went to a psychiatrist, so i cannot say that i am depressed, because i was never diagnosed. But the feeling, tham i am ,keeps bothering me. I do not want to be diagnosed that i am depressed, but i just want some answers, just to know how to deal with it and how to accept what i am feeling, i just do not know.\\n\\nOkay so what is my mood. Firstly i have never been truly happy, well the world is amazing and all, but nothing really made me happy ever. I do not say that i do not get happy, but just never that much happy, that i would say i was trully happy, maybe its normal i do not know. Sometimes there are days, like this day, when i just want to die, i really would love to kill myself. I made plans on how i would kill myself, a couple of plans, because when i go to bed, i start to think of a plan on how to kill myself, its just a thing my brain does most of the times i go to bed. I do not think that killing myself would be a bad thing, i feel such a weak person and also do not want to live, so why not leave this life and let others live it, who want to live, i just feel that i just take up space for people who want to live, for people who are trully happy. I just feel really weak and a coward on not just doing it. I thought about it for the last 13 years of my life, so maybe the time has come and i just need to do it, i just need to have some balls and just freaking kill myself. I just do not see the point of living if i do not want to, there are people who wants to live and dreams big and are happy, so i just want to give them the space for it. So maybe someone could explain to me am i depressed or maybe someone could be the person who would encourage me on killing myself? I just do not know what to do anymore and maybe i just need to have the guts to end it all.It was going to be one of the greatest years of my life. 2019 had been one of the worst years I have ever been through. Depression, suicidal thought (almost daily), strained relationship with my father, the death of my dog (who is saved me from ending it earlier in my life), my \"best friend\" consistently being a dick to me throughout the entire year, etc. etc. etc.\\n\\nSomehow, in january this year, something snapped in me. I was going to turn 2020 into the best year of my life. I started eating better and exercising more, already lost nearly 17 kg so far, I started practising my social skills more, I made sure I got a promotion at work. But then, it all got turned upside down in a heartbeat.\\n\\nThis Corona pandemic has ruined everything. My biggest hobby, which is going to concerts, has now been taken away from me, paranoia within my family has risen to a point where the toxicity levels are at an all time high and now my grandmother, who is one of the only people I have ever felt close with, is in the hospital. Suffering from Corona with a very slim chance of survival.\\n\\nThe one time in my life where I actually got motivated, started bettering myself and was going to make my way out of depression and anxiety so that in the future, I would not have to go through my entire life alone anymore, I could maybe get in a relationship without messing it up due to anxiety and make some connections with people. The one time I started getting a little better everything turned to shit. Just like it always seems to do. Now I have slid back into a depression that is possibly worse than ever before. it is like I have been destined to be taken down to the ground on every step my entire life. I know there is way bigger problems going on in the world right now, but this is just how I feel right now.\\n\\nI hope this year is over quick, because I will make it through. I owe it to my dog and my grandma.I have has anxiety and depression my whole life. I have heard people say it is not possible but i have had panic attacks since i was 3 or 4 years old. \\ngrowing up i was very suicidal. i did not know what anxiety was and i thought i was broken. i wanted to die more than anything. i was cutting myself at the age of 10. \\ni eventually found out what was “wrong” and I have been on lexapro for a couple years now. I have been doing alright. so i thought. I have been proud of myself and i thought i was doing better. \\nand now I am haunted again by urges and thoughts of death. \\nthe pain is a lot to handle and I am not sure if i want to do it anymore. thing is I am almost 24, have an amazing husband who does not deserve this. but i know it would destroy him if i did do it. my mom would probably die. my brother needs me. \\ni just do not want to be needed so i would not feel bad about leaving. it hurts too much and I am over it.Everything I could possibly write sounds stupid right now. I can no longer find the words I want to use to express myself properly because I can no longer think correctly.\\n\\nThinking deeply only yields me anxiety and regret because I do not feel confident with my intelligence. I think about all the mistakes that have made me feel this way, but still I cannot focus on the time still in front of me to change. I have been stupid and lazy when I should have worked hard to preserve myself.\\n\\nPeople who are able to live free and pursue their passions make me feel immense longing and self pity. I can not find my creativity and passion anymore. I am overwhelmed by life and therefor I avoid anything that might crack the glass of every emotion I have bottled for years.\\n\\nWhen it all comes out will it give me the fire I need to live or will it finally break me? I do not feel capable of giving into my gut twisting fear of living free. I want to be alive again. When will I be able to put aside all the bullshit, the self pity, the sleepless nights and wasted days? I just want to feel comfortable in my body again, and at home in my mind.\\n\\nIf these words make sense to you and you have your own version of this phenomenon, please tell me about it and what you have done about it if anything.It really is a stressful time, and shit just keeps getting worse. Love you all.I am scared of getting older, I am afraid that I will never get the chance to truly live. High school is the time for new experiences and excitement, am I missing out on that? Everyday is just so mediocre and repetitive it all feels like a massive waste. What makes my life unique? I have done nothing out of the ordinary, I have no special stories to tell. Will that ever come or will I continue to waste my life away? Everyday I dream of doing something anything exciting but then that day going by the same as the last. And time is going faster now than before before I know it I will be in my 20s then 30s. It just feels like I am missing out on something bigger.For me, depression’s become such a passive thing. \\n\\nIf my mind is a house, then depression is like some gloomy yet almost harmless homeless guy sitting on the front porch smoking a cigarette. He tells me a stoic “Hello” when I wake up, and again at night. Sometimes he will bring up memories I have of people I loved that are gone now, but reliving those moments in my head actually make me happy for a moment. I thank him for these and go about my way. \\n\\nI could be angry at him but I feel like I moved him in here myself, with my choices.I thought I was done with depression. After trying to kill myself about a year and a half ago, I have been making changes to myself, going outside more, making friends, focusing on school, and actually admitting to myself I was trans. I thought things were easier for a while, but I think I was just distracting myself. The reality is finally setting in that I will never be the person I want to be. At my core, I am just a sad, lonely boy who does not deserve anything but to die. Nothing makes me happy anymore and it is been getting worse and worse. I can not get excited for anything anymore and it is getting worse and worse. it is done nothing but make my life worse. My grades have been slipping and my relationship with my friends and partner has just been slipping. I am not doing anything about it except getting drunk and posting on reddit. I am always going to be like this and my situation is just going to get worse and worse until my option is to end it all. Suicide is just inevitable. I do not know when it is going to happen but it will, because no matter how stable I get, it is always going to get worse and I can never escape the pit of depression.I am do not i can not do this anymore i do not want to live i do not want to exist i can not do this anymore\\n\\ncall me selfish or whatever but I am SORRY i can not do this anymore I am so tired I am so scared I am so tired of dealing with my trauma I am so tired of constant flashbacks I am so tired of dealing with my feelings I am so tired of acting happy in front of people\\n\\nI am so tired that i can not even cry anymore \\ni can not sleep i can not get up i can not do anything productive\\ni do not want to exist\\n\\nI am done(I am 23) there is constantly people who have graduated college and are doing something with their lives while I am stuck here being lazy, pathetic, and have no idea what to do with mine. Only thing I was ever good at is typing and rapping but those do not seem to get me anywhere and I am too stupid to do anything else. I literally forget my own friend\\'s names sometimes, it is pathetic. Going on Facebook just makes me even feeling okay to being depressed. Not to mention, being a disappointment to my parents is probably the worse part. Other parents are proud of their kids. Some of my high school friends are even getting married. it is a terrifying feeling knowing that time will probably keep slipping me by.now I am fat ugly fucked up teeth,\\n\\nnow i am not worth peoples time \\n\\ntime to kill myselfevery night it seems that i am fighting with intrusive and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\nmaybe i am selfish. I want the best for me, which is to stop suffering. quickest, easiest way to achieve this death. people talk about life purpose. maybe my purpose is to show people what happens when you do not treat men like humans and partially flay their genitals and torture them sexually as infants. then you tell them they are crazy for being depressed about having the most sensitive part of their body mutilated. i think its crazy that male human infants are the only mammal on earth whose genitals require immediate surgical correction after birth. i have been screaming for years, nobody seems to listen, nobody seems to care. the reason is because i am a male. i am not allowed to have emotions. i am not allowed to cry. anything that falls outside of strong, and stoic, is not accepted.\\n\\nwell, fuck you too society. i will not miss you. my chest hurts with an anger and a pain that yearns to be stopped through suicide. congrats society, you have created another statistic, adding to the 80% of male executed suicides.\\n\\nmy only questions are,\\n\\ndo i make it look like an accident so those who know me are less hurt?\\n\\nOR\\n\\ndo i make it very clear that this was intentional and allow my pain to be felt and understood? <--(funny how people do not care to do this until you are gone)i have been depressed for the last 4-5 years. it is not a constant depression. sometimes it hits for months. sometimes it hits for days.  i would guess it in my last year of middle school.  i would be senior in high school now but i dropped out. my life is not the worst nor best. i am grateful to my mom for what she provided me in life and i do not blame her for my depression at least not anymore. but in her eyes she has done nothing but help me. she has told me from the beginning that she has done everything to help me. i do not know maybe in her eyes she has. unfortunately i have never felt that way. now she has helped me find therapists and got me on meds before. she has always made sure the family was okay.  and please note that i do love her.\\n\\nmy depression started when i became more conscious of myself. i hated how i looked. my mom has a habit of making passive aggressive comments. such as \"you are eating a lot lately\" \"looks like you put on some weight\" \"you are too skinny\"  \"you should year make up to hide your acne\". i remember she would physically pin me down and pop my pimples, even when i resisted and cried. i do not remember exactly when but at some point a little before high school i decided to change how i dressed and looked. i had short hair since i was in 5th grade but now i cut in shorter. i wore baggier clothes. and i changed my name as well. i hated my name back then. she named me unity because i brought the family together.  it never felt that way when my dad and step dad left. i started smoking a lot of weed. i skipped most of my classes. i finished freshman hear with a GPA of 1.6 i think. i remember taking pain meds to get out of Spanish class. i started self harming that year too. i would even do it in class on occasion if i was feeling really bad. i wore hoodies everyday. i remember my step dad was the first to find out. he grabbed me and pulled up my sleeve. \\n\\nthat was also the year i first attempted. it was a weak attempt. i took my mom\\'s pain pills she got from knee surgery. i took whatever pills i could find. i was home alone that night. i took them. i felt so sick. i went and passed out in bed. i really hoped not to see tomorrow i tried 2 days before my 14th birthday. i did wake up, around 3 am i threw up a lot. it hurt so much. i did not have the energy to clean it up. i went back to sleep. \\n\\nas i said before i was going through a point in my life where i changed my identity. so i was not wearing dresses or skirts. i had my best friend over. i do not know what we were doing. we were just hanging out in the room. my mom wanted us to wear skirts for some reason. when we refused she yelled at us the slammed the door locking us in. every time my mom raises her voice even to this day i jolt and cower. i hated my mom for how she yelled at my friend. if it was just me there it would have been fine. I am used to her yelling at me. but why did she have to yell at my friend.  my friend never came over again.  she was my first real friend.  my mom blamed me for it. saying i should have just worn a skirt. \\n\\nlater on my step dad lost his job. this ended up making my mom decide to move. meaning i would be leaving my best friend. we had moved many many times before but it got a lot hard in high school.  i cried the whole drive. she told us it was for our own good. we needed to be closer to family. it would be a fresh start. she never liked any of my friends anyway. she did not like any of my choice and i do admit not all were good. \\n\\nmy new school was nice. i luckily made friends quickly. this was my first indoor school. it was very interesting. the layout was easy understand. i was probably the happiest here. i was still depressed but i was better. i had an art class that i mostly enjoyed the teacher was at times strict. i made her cry because one of my pieces. it was a pretty emotional piece. she hung it up in the library. \\n\\nI have gotten pretty off track but it helps me to write. I am very off topic.  oh wellToday I am a phony, a fake, an attention seeking weak minded individual. Tomorrow morning I will be a strong willed, persistent individual who has overcome tremendous adversity, In the afternoon I will be an angry, overworked genius that does everything but also does it wrong. In the evening I will be a happy accomplished imperfect human ready to accept myself. At night I will be a complete idiot who should die. Someone who was born to suffer. The world will collapse on me. In the morning I will be aThis is my first post to reddit, and honestly I have not read much on here either before now. I just kind of need to talk.\\n\\nMy relationship with my father has been horrible for most of my life, but recently it is gotten worse to the point that I do not even try to connect with him or talk to him at all if I do not have to. Even that is too much of a bother to him, though; a few days ago I overheard him complaining to my stepmom that I keep talking to him, saying that I am annoying and am always trying to get his attention and interrupt his games, and telling her how disrespectful it is that I talk while he has headphones on (for the record, all I say is \"Hey, Dad!\").\\n\\nYou know what I dared inconvenience him with?\\n\\nI was taking the dog for a walk since she had not been out all morning, and he had her in his office.\\n\\nI could not believe what I was hearing. There are days on end where we do not talk at all, and I bother him too much?! it is completely ridiculous. I can not believe I was stupid enough to move back in here, but now I can not leave because the rent went up too much for him to pay on his own when he moved, and my stepmother and brother can not make up the difference, and even if I knew they were okay, I have no money saved up and I barely make enough to even afford to rent a room somewhere.\\n\\nThis is something I have been dealing with all my life, from him, my mom, and my stepmom (although she is genuinely changed and we are on good terms now, as a child she was my worst nightmare). I have trouble making or keeping friendships because I feel like nobody wants me around or really cares. I do not know what to do to fix my life. I have no real friends, I have a job that I do not feel like I am good at or can succeed in, and I am in an environment that is horrible for my mental health but that I can not afford to leave. Part of me wants to just walk out, stay in a shelter and figure out the rest from there.yeah. idk. everyone is depressed. everyone is screaming. people want a positive change they can look forward to. yet universe is silent. life feels meaningless and especially cruel, how we are given shitty circumstances with no blueprint out.\\n\\nshould i make my death look like an accident? or clearly show that it was purposeful? \\n\\nmy chest is tightening with pain. i will need more drugs to appear emotionally normal for work tomorrow. haha yes society i am not a crumbling ball of suicidal thoughts and depression loleven if i do not sleep  well, i am going to push myself and try because i just can not stay like this i just can not wish me luckI can not even compliment people without it somehow turning into them thinking I am lying. I feel like shit. I am just a useless piece of shit. I can not make anyone feel better. All I do is make them feel worse. I am useless. I do not deserve to fucking interact with people. I am actually biting my hand so I do not cry. I am a terrible human being, I should not even be here anymore. I have no outward reason to be depressed.  I have a good life: A beautiful house (that I can not keep clean because I am crippled by depression); a husband who loves me (and worries about me and wants me to \\'fix\\' this); two wonderful grown children that I am proud of. \\n\\nBut I AM depressed. I spend my days in isolation reading and playing mindless games on my iPad. I do not feel like being social, so I make excuses to skip my virtual yoga classes. I feel so guilty about wasting my life! I am 61 and may not have a whole lot of years left, but I am doing nothing worthwhile. I feel mired in cement… I just can not … 😕I do not know for sure but after a long time of feeling like total shit I seem to feel a tad better today. Maybe because I finally slept well. I also got out of bed pretty easily. Strange...\\n\\nSLEEP IS IMPORTANT BUT WHY IS IT SO HARD?!do you ever feel so alone even if ur with a bunch of people that it is actually kinda fucking terrifying. then you want to be alone but when ur alone it is just more lonely??or is that just me?I can not sleep... I wake up 3am from the stress and lack of activity during the day :(\\n\\nI\\'ts like everyday I am alone with my mind trying to keep myself busy so I do not let depression stand out from my other thoughts...when I am asked about my future, I always tell the plan that made me really excited and happy when I was still able to feel those emotions. but I am trying to not think about it at all because if I do, I break down. the reason for that is because I feel absolutely numb and blank towards things. I am trying to keep hopes up that one day I will feel good enough, watching the sun rise while drinking coffee, feeling content and calm with worries so little and so managable. yet when I try to imagine tge future I \"want\", I feel blank and empty inside. I hate it so much and it scares me. it scares me because I am starting to think that if one day I get the future I \"want\", I will feel the same. I will look up at the pretty sky with my favourite cup of coffee and will feel helplessly empty, and that is going to be the end of me.Work, friends, family,\\n\\nMy baseline is suicidal.\\n\\nCaffeine creates a nice dissociative effect for me where I feel highly energized and strangely excited about life.\\n\\nAlcohol dims any pain I am feeling and I am more laid back and easy.\\n\\nPhenibut inflates my ego, helps me socialize, gives me energy, and takes me away from my pain.\\n\\nI still want to kill myself. I am on a constant emotional pendulum, swinging between set on suicide, or thinking \"hey this is not so bad\"\\n\\nI never asked for this pendulum ride. I am asking to get off. It is no longer fun anymore. A gun is the gatekeeper to my eternal peace.Everyday at night I dread going to sleep because it marks another day closer to humility. Closer to losing everything. Closer to being exposed.\\n\\n\\n Closer to uncertainty.Maybe it will be next monday when I can buy a handgun after I get paid. Maybe that is when I will finally stop hurting.I have taken tests, i cry all night, I stay in bed all day, I have self harmed and I think I am, but it feels wrong thinking I am depressed without being diagnosed.So it is been a long while since I have had time with my own thoughts, but now obviously I have more time than I know what to do with. Someone could argue _too_ much time. I know it is cliché, “this too shall pass, it is normal to feel sad/anxious right now,” but I was really _really_ looking forward to getting my life on track this year. I finally started saving up to move into my own place, finally looking for a career, finally about to actually graduate instead of walking on a stage. \\n\\nInstead, now I am staying at home wondering when I will ever be able to see another face again. I am stuck worrying if my parents are going to be okay not just financially but also health wise. I say I am going to keep reading, learning how to code, yatta yatta... but it all just bores me now after a few minutes. I sit at home, maybe go for a run if I am feeling really shitty, but for the most part i skip meals and lose sleep every night (hence my 4am post). I have not showered in days.. My mood changes constantly from irritated one minute, to crying in my sheets the next, then suddenly I am back on my Netflix binge like it never even happened. I am also quick to have a glass of wine (or 4), or maybe I will go to the gas station and buy yet another vape stick flavored just like mint even though the last time I bought one was “definitely the last time,” or maybe I will just keep smoking weed and just numb my emotions for another day longer. I can not seem to shake it anymore. I do not know why I am like this. \\n\\nI have suffered too long from anxiety, I do not want to fall back into these same patterns. I want to be better but I just can not help but think of all the shit going wrong. Am I ever going to get my job back? Will my family be okay? My grandmother just got out of the hospital and is back to living by herself how is she doing? Will I ever get my unemployment benefits? Will society go back to normal, even after this is over? Why am I still thinking about my ex who I know is an asshole and dumped me over 6 months ago? Why am I thinking about how the only people I have ever been romantically attracted to, always turn out wrong? Maybe I am not meant to find love. Maybe I am not meant to live the life I have wanted to. Maybe things would be better if it all ended. what is the point in waking up tomorrow just to do it all over again? I guess my birthday is coming up this week.. but is that even something I can look forward to in a time like this? Sorry for the long post here, I may have rambled a little, I just really wanted to get my thoughts and concerns out there. Because I feel like I am fucking spiraling.I have suffered from depression for far too long already. I have had so many past experiences that have ruined me. From the constant bullying to the way i was raised. Lately, i have been having this thought that if I kill myself, I would be able to relive certain parts of my life again this time the way I exactly wanted it to be. I also tend to think that if I enter this new afterlife, I would be able to have the powers and looks that I want like being able to eat whatever and not get fat (I suffer from anorexia because i love food so much but am always afraid I will get too fat). I also believe that entering this afterlife would mean I get to have the exact living condition i want (i am actually pretty well off but I do not feel like i have enough). Overall, i believe that if i enter this afterlife, i get to live the present and the future exactly the way I want to and i will finally be happy. I am sick and tired of feeling like everything is not enough. I am tired of feeling like I am not enough. I have been working so hard to reach my dreams of becoming one of the best music producers and mix engineers but there is always got to be something that is stopping me from reaching my goals like school or not having the best gear. Overall, i just do not feel like I am enough and i feel like jumping into this afterlife would make me finally be free of the prison that is our current reality.Been quite depressed for the past 6 month, would not go as far as saying I am doing a depression but I am definitely not ok. \\n\\nI (23F) have lots of friends (which I am grateful for) but I just do not feel close to any of them and I am always scared they are going to abandon me. I was getting my sh\\\\*t together but Corona time and being stuck at home had put me right back down. I have had many people abandoning me, hence the issues. I sometime find it funny to write them because there is just so much it makes me wonder if something is wrong with me or if I am just cursed.\\n\\n\\\\-Back in the days when I was about 15, I got in a fight with my best friend at the time and she turned everyone against me so that I got kicked out of the group (At 15, those friends were my only friends) There were about 17 people in this group and I am still friend with 3 of them.\\n\\n\\\\-My ex-boyfriend (worst thing that ever happen to me) broke up with me but kept telling me he loved me and wanted to come back with me for 2 years after the breakup when we had been dating for 1 year only. Being young, dumb and in love I waited but he was just using me.\\n\\n\\\\-I moved to another country quite far and the girl that I considered my best friend told me after a bit that I was downgraded to just a friend.\\n\\n\\\\-My best friend of 2 years told me he had feelings for me and did not want me around because he was scared he would do something he would regret, he also had depression but I could not help him since he did not want me around. He pretty much broke up with me at that point. 4 month after while on a road trip with 6 friends he snapped and yelled at me telling me the last good memory he had with me was from 1.5 year prior. I had no idea he was resenting me that much until he said so. \\n\\n\\\\-My other ex-boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks after my best friend did the same and told me after 1 year of dating that he never loved me and was waiting for feeling to develop but it never did. \\n\\nMy best friend and my boyfriend both broke up with me within 2 weeks so did not have a lot of people I could talk to.\\n\\nAdd on top of that my family problems because I still live at home with both my parents, my university problems since I can not seem to be able to focus and do enough work, the fact that I can not climb anymore (my passion and stress relief activity) and you get a good idea while I am feeling this way\\n\\nMy life in funHi i want someone to talk to..I am just so lonely right nowI will not go into the details, my psychotherapist helped me come to the decision I have been putting off for so long.\\n\\nMy parents are okayish but one does not believe mental health exists and the other one thinks I am depressed because I do not eat meat. 🙃\\n\\nI need to tell them eventually and it would be much worse to let them know a year after I dropped out or so... \\n\\nWhat can I tell them? I do not mind lying, I would tell them I have a physical illness if I knew it is bulletproof.\\n\\nThanks,stay strong budsSo much potential and so many aspirations right down the toilet with the rest of my life. I would consider myself a rational person and using my better judgement I feel like I should just end this game and start over. I understand that is not how it works but I just want to escape this growing pile of life mistakes that I keeps me up at night.I feel like shit. I am an ugly bastard and I cringe every time I look at a photo of myself, I can not bear the look of my face and I bet it pains others as well. I do not have any friends I feel a connection with, and even then I just feel like people shove me to the side. This wells up an incredible amount of anger and sadness within me that I simply do not know how much longer I will be able to contain, I do not even know how to socialize easily, or perhaps it is the fact that people do not want to be friends with me because of my looks. The only people I hold dear to me are my parents, who have love and kindness for me, even though I am currently living with my brother and cousin as well. Maybe I should just disappearI feel absolutely empty. I have lost most of my friends in the recent months, and had to end things with my girlfriend of 2 years. I try to keep up relationships with a small group of people but even they are getting tired of me. I reach out and ask people how they are doing, and nobody ever does the same back. If I stopped messaging people entirely, I would not get any messages starting a conversation; I start them all. My own family can not stand to talk to me. I just want somebody who will care about me like I care about everybody else, but it is never come. I asked a friend for help a few days ago, and her boyfriend got on her phone and told me to screw off. It was the first and only time I would asked for help, and that was what I got for it.Time and time again I have done this, and every time I come back my stress tolerance/anger tolerance gets lower and lower. I can not handle this life anymore...I understand that I do not deserve to ever feel okay. I never have and I never will. Sometimes I go through periods of pure apathy. I go through the motions of my day with no feeling. But sometimes I go through weeks where all I do is sob and moan. My neighbors hate me. They hear me through the walls and floors. But I can not stop.I am not going to have some magical revaluation. I am just going to be lonely. Lonely for being unable to confront why, and lonely because no one really cares when things get dicey with my mental health. Honestly I wish everyone said their true intentions rather than skip around them.\\n\\nI wish everyone had decency to others\\' problems.I have exhausted every explanation. Silence is my only answerIt has been roughly a month or two since I have been sewn tightly with the demon that is depression. Ever since learning about it and becoming diagnosed with it by my local health department, I have progressively debilitating memory, my ability to do basic responsibilities (taking care of the family pets, brushing my teeth) has become hellishly hard, and to my surprise, I have lost myself in this dark, but strangely comforting abyss.\\n\\nI have been taking Wellbutrin (150mg) for about a month or longer, sometimes missing days and sometimes even with the knowledge that I need to take them by getting out of the bed, forget about it entirely. Initially when getting into antidepressants, my mother noted my eyes were clear, and I was more lively.\\n\\nBut now...I feel as if I have slowly faultered off it is effectiveness. Though it made me periodically happy, it never got me to the point where I wanted to take action in life. Really, nothing changed.\\n\\nMy entire decision on taking Wellbutrin over other depressants was to conserve a source of energy I have plenty of - sexual. Reading on Reddit and especially doing the research, I found that most SSRIs kill libido, which though not very sexually active with others, is a high driving force that I have yet to control.\\n\\nSometimes spikes of energy hit me enough to get a little bit done, but at the most inconvenient times (the sudden invigoration to clean out my whole closet at bedtime).\\n\\nBut despite all this, I have become selfish and irrationally jealous and angry at the success of people who seem to have everything together. I know they do not, but they act so well like they do. I dream of the day where I can draw and write of a quality that yawns a jaw wide, dream to feel sexy and wanted, dream to feel love. I have a family that cares about me, but I do not feel that except for my mother. I have several people on my friend\\'s list and yet I feel completely alone. \\n\\nI have completely secluded myself from Twitter from artists I enjoy because I am now jealous that the beauty they create completely squanders any characters, worlds, ideas or more that I could ever create. I am weeks behind on class work at my college. I have never felt so powerless. I even - without conscious thought, bought a BB gun to practice overcoming the fear of death. I bought pellets and metal targets to persuade my parents into thinking I wanted to pass the time, but the purpose and practice of me fingergunning my head, into my mouth or under the chin had and still is a constant pastime.\\n\\nDepression is piloting me into hell, and I just do not know where to start. Journaling feels seldom an idea that works, people say they are there for me to talk to, but I never can get the words out or I feel they would never understand.\\n\\nAnytime anyone says everything will be alright, I feel myself go semi-ballistic. Anytime anyone asks too many questions that are of the same caliber just differently worded, the same happens. I lash out verbally, often.\\n\\nI created this account not as a pity party or to be babied. But as a way to get a direct answer and order to follow so that I can push myself to remember who I am, to condition myself to never be jealous or envious of the art around me and realize I can make something just as beautiful, and how to condition and steel myself to deal with moments like this where I could crash again. I do not want that anymore.\\n\\nHow do I find out who I am? How do I decide jealousy from my system? How do I prevent this from happening at the magnitude that it is, again?I was given a lot of time fr my project, but I keep procrastinating. I kept thinking about what I could add to the project to improve it, but I did not do any of those things. I kept dreaming about how I will do the project but never actually put in the effort. In fact, I just found out what I have done so far is kind of off topic. The project is due very soon and I have not even submitted my first draft. I feel really depressed and unmotivated now. I dream and yet never did anything. I am a failure.I maybe left the house a total of 50 times or less in a total of 4 years due to major depressive disorder, I was diagnosed treatment resistant last year after trying every treatment known to man with zero reliefI have been depressed for coming up on 4 years now, I have tried just about every treatment there is known. Zero relief. Has anyone ever recovered after being depressed so long?Depressed for 4 years now, diagnosed treatment resistant. I have tried every treatment there is with zero relief. what is next?Back in 2018 and early 2019 I was extremely depressed. I have always been a loner and struggled with anxiety but those two years hit me the hardest. I thought nothing was going to better. Then a girl that I was friends with for a very long time confessed that she had feelings for me. I thought everything was finally looking up for me. We ended up dating and I did not feel depressed anymore, I genuinely believed that I was getting better. She actually listened to me and cared for me. Then not even a year later, she breaks my heart. The way she talked to me after our breakup made it seem like she never even loved me to begin with. \\n\\nSo here I am, almost a week later, and it is hitting me really hard. I miss all the good memories and being in love. I keep blaming myself for the breakup and I do not know why. I only have one friend, and she is trying her best to make me feel better. But I am honestly crushed and I feel more depressed than I was before I got in a relationship with my ex. I truly believe I am meant to be alone forever because there is no way I will ever have another girlfriend. Everyone just leaves me anyways.\\n\\nSometimes I just wish I would have just ended everything back in 2018 like I wanted to.Title. I had a bunch of school assignments I should have gotten done, I should have cleaned my room, etc. But with quarantine, what is the point? My grades can not decrease, who gives a shit about my room, and what is the point to doing anything else?on top of quarantine and never leaving my house, which is leading me onto a huge spiral of depression, my boyfriend just broke up with me. he said he does not love me anymore. which i understand, you can not help your feelings, but god, you could not have picked a worst time to do it. \\n\\nI am in so much pain. i want to escape all of this. i do not know what to do anymore. i guess I am not worthy of love or affection. i understand, i guess. it just hurts. he was my world, i was so madly in love...he was the only reason i felt better during these times. fuck, i can not take this.This is the only way I can live, past few years have been rough, and just keep getting worse. People say look for the light at the end of the tunnel , but that is hard to do when you care about everyone else and they never care about what happens to you.I am having a bout of depression, just needed a place to put it besides my journal. Some friends told me I can tell them anything anytime, but right now I do not want to word-vomit my mood to them too much. Nobody needs to respond. I can not put into words how hollow and lonely I am at this moment; I know I will not feel it as strongly when I wake up, which is somewhat a silver lining.\\n\\nIf you too are having a dark night of the soul, you are not alone. I am not alone. I just feel alone. As if a pane of glass stands between me and everyone in the world. I want so badly to reach out and connect. it is as if my humanity\\'s slipped away. \\n\\nThanks for letting me stamp my mind onto a board for the night. I know many of you are struggling. Hang in thereI feel so worthless, so bad. I just want to be fucking happy. I want to stop crying and I want it to stop hurting. Because everything hurts and I feel like it will never stop and I do not know what to do. I do not know what to do.I am a guy, I already want to die and I will do it soon, iv been so deppresed since I was 13 because of a very traumatic experience I went through, I was raped, and I even tried to kill myself already at 15, I basicly mixed and swallowed a tons of pills, and for some reason all it did was make me sick for a few days, that was it\\n\\nI am 18 now and i have really tried to keep it under control and I feel far worse, I do not see myself living past 19, life for me it is completely unbearable.I am never happy, I am never sad, I am just... empty I guess.Can i go back to being a kid againAnyone’s breath be so bad from not brushing for a day or 2 and you can taste it?I do not know if I have depression or not but getting a real diagnosis just is not an option for me. Around 2 years back i was a very happy person and out of the blue my mind just went completely blank. I could not talk to people because there was nothing in my mind and as a result I became very anxious and insecure. I skipped a lot of school and found myself becoming an emotional person out of nowhere. I was crying at movies and stuff like that. I was honestly confused more than anything as to why I was feeling this way and I kept trying to write it off as an off day but this lasted maybe ~5 months. \\n\\nI found some ways to deal with it so I was not as hopeless but I still felt happy at times throughout those months and I still do now and I do not know if what I think is “depression” is just a natural circumstantial emotional response. For instance I really do not like myself but it is just because I do things that are annoying, so is my low self esteem just a natural product of that instead of me having depression? Like if I was very likable and was popular and pretty I do not think I would be “depressed”. I have also self harmed a couple of times but I think deep inside I was doing it for some kind of attention or as a confirmation that I have actual depression and I am not just a loser, and I get urges to self harm whenever I feel overwhelmed but I do not know if I am subconsciously wanting to do that for attention because I know there is other ways to cope. \\n\\nSorry if this is confusingly worded btw but I just want to know if I am actually depressed or just circumstantially sad at times so I know how to deal with thisI want to leave something behind, but I can not seem to begin to build anything. I want to love, but I can not be loved back—not wholly, not unconditionally, the way I want to love.\\n\\nI used to not care, but only recently, I learned what it means to give a damn about yourself. I almost wish I had not come to that realization. It forces me to see that almost everyone else begins with this condition—knowing intuitively it is not only acceptable but perhaps even imperative to love the self. In the grand scheme, it is perhaps both inconsequential and myopic to obsess over such trivial matters; but I have chosen to disregard this truth as a result of the aforementioned realization.\\n\\nI learned someone loved me, but they can not fully love me, at least not now, at least not without consequences. It would be a disaster, but I pray for that disaster to materialize. The mere thought of building a new life from the scattered debris of a ravaged tower is perhaps a delusion, but that delusion is all I have; so I cling to it, even if it makes me appear a desperate, lonely madman, which is what I must confess I have recently been reduced to.\\n\\nShe has her obligation, which I understood from the beginning, something I never thought she or I could overcome—until recently, when she and I became closer then I ever could have imagined. I will remain distant, I bargained, until the storm passes, if it passes at all; but I was warned maintaining such distance as a matter of volition was an impossibility, at which point I resigned myself to the contemptible verity that I am merely a laborer of my own mind’s undiscerning whims.\\n\\nHow does one break free under such conditions? Once again surrender to that ever-encroaching pit of stagnation? Pray for the annihilation of that which will never be broken? Or battle through the biological impulse to remain alive for the benefit of all who secretly despise you?\\n\\nI do not want to think about where she is now. I do not want to think about where she will be tomorrow. Yet when she is with me, such terror dissipates. Perhaps it is yet another delusion of mine to believe that the terror will not again return.I myself struggle with problems caused by my depression. But I wanted to hear your story as to how depression may have come about in your life, and what is it that keeps you pushing, whether to just make it through the day or to just get better in general.Anyone would have thought I was ok, I have gotten good at acting like nothing’s wrong. Then out of nowhere I am just like let us do it today. I wish there was someone I could talk to other than a therapist about this stuff. I have brought it up to my sister who I am very close with and she is very honest with me when she says she does not know how to react to that. But then I am like well if someone I loved who is life is seemingly perfect/ normal/good told me they want to die I would not know how to react either. If I were hearing myself I would think what more does she want. She has a supportive family, good social life, stable job, nice things, phones cars ,food, roof above her head, not wealthy but also not dirt poor, I have everything and yet I want to die.i hate pain, i hate causing it, i wish i never existed.When I was in tenth grade I had a crush on this teacher, Mr.C. Not a spouse crush but a crush in a way where i wanted him to be a father figure to me. I was obsessed with standing out to him so he would like me, but everytime I talked to him I would come out awkward and shy. Last year, 11th grade, I walked back from the counselors office crying. I was put down by the counselor being  condescending. Through walking that hall all I wanted was Mr.C to be there. I wanted him to comfort me and tell me everything was going to be alright. I looked down as I cried when all of a sudden I see Mr.C turning the corner. I became shy and anxious. I remember him noticing me crying. He said \"How are you\"in a sympathetic voice. I managed to mumble out a broken \"good\" as I swiftly walked past him. He said \"good, that is great\" and walked past me. That was it. No comfort, no acknowledgement, nothing. I walked to my class and he continued on his way. I wonder if he ever looked back. If he ever cared to ask me what was really wrong. Last year he got engaged. I was happy for him but jealous. Not of his wife but of his children who will grow up with a great dad. He moved to a different school this year and probably forgot my name.I have always struggled with my mental health, but I have always just brushed it off. I get really anxious over everything and sad, but it feels like everyone does. This is probably going to turn into a long incoherent rant, but I have never expressed how I felt before. I have lived a very privileged life and grew up in an amazing community. I love my parents (they are immigrants and worked really hard to get where they are). I just feel so guilty for being so sad all the time. I do not even know why; I am just always sad. But its always manageable; I do well in school, and I am going to a really good university in the fall. I have several close friends, but I am just so lonely all the time. I do not know why I feel so guilty. I thought my mental health had been improving over the years, but today I was so angry and irritated at everything and I do not know why. (and its not my period because I can also get very bitchy before my period). I just got so mad and I have been sitting on my floor for hours. I even cut myself for the first time in a really long time (I never did it much, but I have a hard time crying, so it helps me feel something when I get stressed). I have always thought my mental health issues were not bad, and I am insecure, but what hormonal teen is not. Wow this is really long, and I do not know if anyone will read this. I want to talk to someone, but every time it gets this bad, I chicken out, and then it usually passed quickly and I just shove all my emotions deeper, and I will be fine, and not think about it for a while. I get so anxious making an (semi) anonymous post. I have only posted on reddit once before. I do not know why I got so angry today, and I feel so bad for being angry even though I did not seem angry. Sometimes I will get so angry at things that do not even matter, and I spend so long obsessing over it. it is also not like I can not control my anger, but then again I just bottle everything up. I also want to stop obsessing over everything; it makes me so stressed. I sent a text to a friend and I thought I sounded mean and got so worried, but it was not even mean, I was just answering her question. I feel like everyone hates me, but then I feel like no one cares about me. All my mental health symptoms seem so mild to me; I just do not want to feel like this all the time. This will probably pass in a few days anyways.Background: I am a 14 year old freshmen. I am doing great on my online learning, everything completed to perfection and turned in on time but I feel empty. This quarantine has been really rough for me mentally. I feel like I am wasting away. I feel so insecure about my weight and I want to do something about it but I constantly think I am being judged by everyone so I skip. I can not even fast right; I wanted to fast so I could lose weight, 1 hour later I was having a second portion of dinner. The thing that depresses me the most is my gaming addiction, I will spend 8 hours a day on it, only a couple of nights ago did I play until 12 and it was soul crushing, I had friends with me but I felt like I am wasting away my youth. All I do is sit inside all day either watching anime, playing video games, or sitting in my room thinking of bad things are. My biggest fears have not even came yet. My biggest fear is summer, I live near a public pool and I love going swimming, until recently, my body image issues have gotten so bad I do not even want to go swimming. How can I compete in looking passable when I am swimming with friends who are athletes. This concludes my 1 am rant about how My life seems terrible but really is not.All I do is keep thinking about the past, remembering memories whether they were bad or good...\\nI feel sad when I remember the bad ones , but sadder when I remember the good ones and know that they will never be lived again ....\\nMemories with my father, friends, persons who I will never get to share life with again whether because they are dead or because they are alive but can not be together cuz that is how life is.\\n\\nThe future is also so exhausting for me to think of... \\n\\nI spend most of my day by myself in my room, mostly doing nothing ... I do not have real friends, just connections whom I do not hang out with, I feel bored easily of people....\\n\\nWhat do you guys think about thid ? And How to get out of this state please?I do not really know the friends I have, or if I can even consider them that in the first place. They all live in time zones hours ahead of mine, and I have never seen them in person. One of them, I happen to have a crush on. They reply really sparsely, yet they are always apologising for just that. I do not know if they are just putting up with me for the hell of it. Maybe because they feel sorry for me? I have always been frightened that I am uninteresting, and even when it seems like I am having a good conversation, I can not help but wonder if they care at all.\\n\\nThis always affects my ability to focus properly, I am always tired and it hurts me mentally. there is a balcony just outside the front door, and it fuels my thoughts of suicide. I berate myself, while actually visualising jumping off, but I know I could never commit suicide. I am absolutely too scared to do it (my fear of heights sure helps), and the pain it would bring my family would be horrible.\\n\\nI want some kinda help, but not medication, and not a therapist. Yes, I know that my problems are menial, and I do not have the worst depression out there. There are people here who have it much worse than I do, and believe me, I support them all the way, but I can not help but feel as if I am worthless.Insomnia, loneliness, memories that just will not leave my brain alone. I am so fucking tired of this all. I want a break. I want to rest. I want my life back... I want my wife back. I miss it all. Transitioning is such a double edged sword. I can not not be me... but it all went downhill after starting. Fuck am I supposed to do, now? I have methods to go; that helps reassure me. it is like every day I am more ok with just going...\\n\\nthere is a universe where shit goes right for me. there is got to be.There have been 2 instances within the last 7 days of my dark mind taking over my body and ordering me to use a towel like a damn noose and strangle myself with it. The second instance was earlier tonight. I collapsed and almost passed out. My life is agony.I do not rly know how to start this so ig I will just get into it but i... genuinely feel like I am not good enough for people and that I am lacking, especially for my boyfriend\\nHe reassures me time and time again that i am good enough and that i treat him rly well and nicely but i feel like he is only saying that to try and appease me and that if we lived together he would see how shitty and useless i am and will want to leave and will regret ever loving me and wasting time on me (we are in a ldr)\\n\\nI feel stupid and useless, i doubt i can get a job so I am worried about us living together and me just being a burden which makes me believe that i would need to eat less or not at all and try not to use too much electricity or water so that the bills will not be too high\\n\\nEven now at home, majority of my family (save for my sister in law) all work from home and are contributing something but I am not doing anything at all so i feel bad and like I am leeching off of them\\nSo i try not to eat too much so we can save on food and water (drink, not shower) because of the pandemic going on also\\n\\nI do not rly have anyone to talk to this about and even if i want to talk about smth to my psych i can not because i Physically and Emotionally cannot ever appear to be Not okay if I am seeing someone in person or if i know this person already\\nLike if i even try to try to talk about my feelings or vent out to a friend or even to her (psych) I will feel super guilty for it and like I am a brat\\nI have wanted to talk to her abt more serious things but i just can not and end up talking about other things that do not impact me as much as the Big Things i want to talk about\\n\\nIdk, ig i just wanted to vent out here so i do not really expect anyone to reply to this but if you read the whole thing, thank you for your timeI was clinically depressed for over two years. Now, after intensive therapy and a long rollercoaster, I am moving out/have finally moved out of clinical diagnosis. My therapy sessions are spreading out more and I am on the verge of no longer needing them anymore. I have not seriously thought about hurting myself in a long time. I do not know who I am without this though.\\n\\nMy therapist and I have been talking about this the last few sessions; I need to find an identity that does not revolve around me being depressed. I do not know how to do that. I do not know how to not center my being around me being broken. I do not feel broken anymore but I feel lost. Who do I even talk to about this? is not talking about it playing into the problem? is not me asking my friends or my family \"who am I without my depression\" making it about my depression? How do I let my loved ones know that I am scared and lost without also making it feel like something is wrong with me? I know that I am not any less because of my depression. I know that I am not broken because of it. But that is all I know. And I need to know more.Idk why I am here. I think I am depressed but idk. I just feel so lonely like every day. And have felt like this for many years. Friends are starting to be more distant. I have never had true love or even anything close to it. And I barely have any family. I do not know what to do. I have almost stopped caring about anything. This corona shit is not helping my situation either. Idk what to expect from this reddit. Just wanted to get this off my chest because nobody close to me knows what I have been going through.i do not know if it is because i do my best to stay as happy as possible, or if i prefer to be with other people to stay away from my thoughts, but after my friends leave a call or an outing, i just get this feeling in my chest. like the huge weight that was gone temporarily is back. it feels horrible and it just makes everything worse. I am all alone with my the brain that tries to ruin my life everyday. no distractions. it is awful.My brain feels like a fried egg in a chair. Anhedonia and no dopamine, just fully friedDM for details.I had decided I was done with coasting. I do not enjoy forcing myself to work on my creative endeavors. I want to enjoy them. And those endeavors are really the only thing left I can think of that could give my life meaning.\\n\\nSo I decided the only thing I want is ketamine/Spravato. My psychiatrist was trying to prescribe it to me, but they could not get their insurance in order. Going to a lab instead of a doctor is prohibitively expensive. I decided I would wasted enough of my life, and if I could not get legal drugs, promising illegal drugs like ketamine and MDMA would have to be my recourse.\\n\\nAnd now this virus stuff happened. I barely knew where to find what I was looking for before - I am hardly going to find it now. So I have to wait even longer. And I am just waiting to live. Wasting my life.So I just started Zoloft yesterday at 25mg (and eventually will go to 50mg) but I had some questions about side effects? I noticed that my veins looked more prominent, is that normal? I know that the extreme tiredness and the lack of focus and sensitivity to light and sound are normal side effects in the beginning, but I just want to make sure I am covering all my bases! I am so terrified of taking medication and how its making me feel but I am really trying to give this a go......You see here, the reason I am still alive is because I have been controlled by a type of devil named feelings. I always wanted to die and I hate my life every single day even the small things to the big things at my point make me think that. I was always a happy looking person, but deep down I am a dead body buried deep down the soil in a coffin. I have always wanted to kill myself but if I did what would happen. First of all, nobody would believe the fact I killed myself, and they would wonder why. Normally, I look like a normal person outside since I would not express myself a lot to other people. I might leave my family and my friends and they would be sad and depressed and now that would because more and more and more never ending problems. You see you are being controlled by this world this hell like society forcing you to do things you do not like and brainwashing you. But there is also another thing that is torturing you, it belongs to you but somehow you cannot control it. It is your feelings, you might wonder, why? Here, let me explain, so look at why you will not kill yourself since it is because the society brainwashed you saying that it is bad and cowardly, and by leaving your family behind and feelings will make you *feel* guilty. The reason you did not do the things you love is because this society and the devil feelings is controlling you right now. Everything you know, everything you say is controlled by feelings and society. So let us look at this shit at the other angle. What if, you just got cancer, out of nowhere, it happened and you would die. That would be great but that is where feelings would come in and start torturing you. You would not want to leave your family behind but you wanted to die which in this scenario it have accomplished your dreams for you. But sometimes a person’s feelings is an angel to them they would do anything to make themselves happy. Now that is where society comes in and starts torturing them. want to know why? Here, since they would do anything to fill their joy and if an *angel feeling* person killed themselves since they would not think too much and that will lead to trouble for people around him. Sounds bad right, it sounds bad because society brainwashed you. It wants you to think the way that you were not supposed to think. Why is life hard, it is because of the modern society and depression is becoming more common and more common because of all these shit. The feelings, the stress, the people are all because of this society. Why would your feelings become a devil trying to make you think the other way. You were born in this horrible society, it is how it worked when you were born. And fuck it, fuck this society, fuck this world, fuck everything I own, fuck you god, why would this happen to us at this specific time. Why would these rare angel feelings exist, maybe some people think the other way, for some reason, these people think the other way when they are born. Or, maybe they developed other things living here in this hell but really rare. It matters the most about how you wanted to think and this world controls that. It is making you depressed and it is making us bad. Well, at the end of this long crap which might be bad, I hope you would find yourself a better future, and think that the reason of living is not because of money since the society is like that, the society make life worth money and a lot of people including me wants to end it. I hope this post makes you feel better. And wow, you made it down here, thanks! See youSuffering with depression for the past 4-5 years and I have had help on and off.\\n\\nOne of the worst symptoms I think I experience is irritability and anger. It is just out of hand at this point. \\n\\nI mainly divert my anger towardd my family and never my friends or strangers or classmates. \\n\\nBut I lash out terribly at them , especially my mom. My poor mom. It gets rough sometimes, and it really only just starts with me back talking. Which will then result in her talking back to me sometimes and then I will completely lose my shit, and just shout or swear. \\n\\nI do not ever usually yell any insults directed towards her, I will usually just mindlessly yell about my anger, or sometimes I will yell at her blaming her for how I am now, or yell at her over a stupid argument over something like a cup, etc.. alongside that, if I am in a bad mood I will just snap back at her my response instead of responding like a civilized person.\\n\\nI feel bad, but In the moment I do not always feel bad. I have a hard time finding a healthy outlet for my thoughts so i personally believe that it comes expressed through aggression.\\n\\nIt is usually that I am sensitive and I just pick fights with everyone in the house. \\n\\nIts terrible because I know I am being a pain in the ass, but it is worse because I do not have it under control and I am putting people I care about under unacceptable remarks and a bitchy attitude all because I had a bad day.\\n\\nIs this something meant for anger management?\\nAre there any mechanisms that can get me to stop myself before I lash out? To recognize that there are innocent people I deeply care about in front of me and that I should not act that way towards them? I can feel my rage unnecessarily build up in the moment and then before I know it, it unleashes on everyone.I have been planning my suicide for a while now. I just needed to figure out how exactly. Well I have settled. Shotgun to the face while sitting on train tracks. 100% death rate.\\n\\nMy problems? \\n\\ncan not connect with anyone.\\n\\nI am 5\\'9 which is very short to most people it seems.\\n\\nI am 75% black 25% Korean so nobody looks like me.\\nI am unemployed.\\n\\nNo car or license.\\n\\nNot in school.\\n\\nI sleep on a couch.\\n\\nMy penis is 6 inches give or take which is apparently really small.\\n\\nI am starting to get skinny fat.\\n\\nI am 22 and losing my youth.\\n\\nDepression stole my teen years.\\n\\nI am apparently attractive but I am too fucked up for anyone to love.\\n\\nThe only girl who would love me left after I fucked it up.\\n\\nI am still stuck on said girl since December 2018.\\n\\nI have got Tinnitus that is probably connected to my TMJ/Dz but I am too scared to call a dentist/specialist and being told I am not enough of an emergency to see.

I officially skipped class today from zoom university, and just went back to sleep until 3pm. Then I just laid in bed for a while... This quarantine has really made me think on how much of a waste my life has been and I do not really see anything changing anytime soon. I just do not feel like I have much left to live for.Today was a great day. My girlfriend dumped me out of nowhere and said it is not you it me. I know this was a lie and it crushed me. Later on in the day my friend got mad at me for not reason and said nobody loves me, the said part is I know that is true. I feel like there no point to any of this shit called life anymore. Now I am just sitting in my room with a rope around my neck. God I hate being alive it is all pain and suffering, nothing matter we all die in the end.At night I lay awake next to my boyfriend thinking about how little motivation I have to do my school work, to go to work, to get dressed, to be productive. I sometimes catch myself thinking “I do not want to be here.” But what I mean is I wish everything outside this apartment did not exist. I wish it was just us, here. I wish there was no stress or pressure from the outside.  I want to be happy.During my last semester at university I failed two of my classes, Calc and Chem. I did not really seem to mind it at the time and I figured I would just grind more for the next semester but after classes started back up in January I got into a real bad headspace and have not been able to get out of it. I am failing the same two classes and have not had any motivation to study or do homework. Initially I thought it would pass but it has not and now I am fairly convinced it is legitimate depression. Every time I try and do anything productive I think to myself I am useless and stupid and I will never graduate. I have been feeling inadequate because my gf is a 4.0 student with a full ride to college and even though she is supportive of me I can not help but feel now that all I am is a burden to her and that I drag her down. All of this shit is from one bad semester but I just do not know what to do anymore. If anyone has any advice for how to get over this I would be greatly appreciative.I really do not want to go into why but I just want to say that they are 100% worth calling. I have had so many nights like tonight where the thought creeps in and takes over and calling them rarely crosses my mind and when it does I immediately reject the idea out of denial that it would do any good. Tonight they really helped me. I am a very sensitive person and need to be spoken to in a specific sort of way and oh my god they did it. Of course I am not cured of depression or anything but I really needed that reassurance and comfort tonight. If you are ever hesitant to call, just do it. They will not give you cookie cutter responses like you might be expecting and are definitely worth a try for when you are at your lowest.So this is basically an explanation of how this makes the person I am. You can imagine the things I have to deal with in my everyday life having all these things. When I´m at home the only thing I do is sleep, eat, use my phone, and relax with my dog. My family ignores all my issues and says that I can control my actions. I can´t control myself because I have mixed feelings on what to do and what to say so I end up doing the wrong thing. At school, I isolate myself because I don´t want to make myself look like a fool trying to talk to someone. Making friends is something I don´t try anymore because I rarely make friends when I try to talk to someone. Whenever I do try people look at me try to talk and mix up my words and just look weird. So I don´t try anymore. I just wait until someone comes up and tries to talk to me. I rarely have someone come up and talk to me. There´s this one girl that loves to mess with me. She lives close to me so that´s not good. Basically she´s made me into her ¨servent¨ because I lost to her in something that was important. My family would leave the house to me on the weekends because they would go to my grandmother´s place and she has a cat and I´m allergic to cats.

This girl would go to my house on the weekends when my family left. When she would come in it would basically be her in my room sitting on my bed talking about her life and all the drama she´s facing while making fun of me as I´m lying in my bed. I don´t tell my parents because I enjoy her company even though she´s mean to me. Before I counting you on, I know this story isn´t that depressing but I want to entertain the people who are having hard times and make them feel better.

I wish I could finish this story but I have to do something important.Depressed teen here, hi:) I am your typical good grades no drugs or alcohol girl, the one everyone thinks is super smart and has a future but just got the short stick on circumstances. I have grown up my whole life afraid, afraid of what people might think, or do, or might act. If I do not do the right thing I will get punished, or yelled at. Maybe I will be kicked out and not able to finish school. I worry often, about everything. The only reason I am alive is because my brother and sister but mainly my cat. My cat has been missing for weeks and I played it off as I could not help it, like it is not my fault. Today, I was doing my online classes and biology sucks. Finally I just broke down, all my stress I have been keeping in, my thoughts, my sadness. I just cried, and I cried, at first I blamed it on my biology homework but I know that it was deeper than that. I kinda laid in my bed for the last few hours just, waiting, for nothing.\\n\\nMy window has a ledge off it where I can go put on, if I fell I would not die but would definitely get hurt. But I can also climb higher up. Anyway, I have always been scared to do anything “bad” because what if I get caught? What if the moment I decide to do something someone catches me or shows up? The neighbors? Anyone. But tonight I opened my window, I crawled out and I sat against my window. I played my music. I felt like at any moment I could slip from this ledge and... if I fell, I would be caught. Not even concerned for myself. And I sat there, and I laughed. I laughed for a good five minutes. My legs were trembling and I laughed.\\n\\nI do not know if I have deeper root problems or something but, that is the first time I ever did anything “bad” like sneaking out or what not. I felt crazy for laughing, but it felt so good. \\n\\nShortened: I am a goody two shoes with depression and tonight I did something I usually would not and I laughed and do not think that is normal but it felt good:)\\n\\nId like to add, I hope this post is not offensive and you think I am just some teen who had a moment and thought she was depressed. I would like to clarify I have been suicidal, scared and depressed since I was 12 years old. (Just for clarifications sake idk? I just feel like I have to explain myself? And I do not want to go that deep into it. Anyway have a goodnight)I want to bleed all over the place and be put under intensive care to prove that I am as sad as I say I am. To see who really cares. And the feeling of blood pouring out is like no other. It can not be that bad can it? I once slowly stabbed into my wrist with a dull box cutter. I will never forget the pop noise when it got through. Then I cut a small piece of skin out with scissors. Stabbing my stomach quickly can not hurt as much as that can it?.kind of a rant ...\\nmy ex got into three Ivy League Universities and it triggered this. \\n\\nThis Covid-19 because me to loose my support system, I live in a difficult household so I am on edge constantly. I FaceTimed my psych (which I do in secret) and she said I should go up 50mg more on my prescription and I was relatively happy talking to her? Am I blind? I do not know how I feel and what if she sees something I can not? This just justifies my insecurities, I thought I was getting better?! \\n \\nFast forward a few days to now: \\nso I think being perfect will cure my depression, hA so my ex got into these schools and I am here with uva which 10 people (among such I do not enjoy) are going with me. I feel like there is something so wrong with me to be rejected I think why them what do they have that I do not? Maybe If I was not so depressed for the past two years I would have done better in high school! I think I am dumb I think I am not good enough and I never will be. I whisper into the faceless sea of the internet, such words that could never be given voice\\n\\nI love you. I really do and I have known you such a long time.\\n\\nI wanted to tell you those months ago. I have wanted to tell you all this time...and now you keep on hitting up my phone, like I will be working in the city next year with you. \\n\\nAnd all I can think about is what would it be like?\\n\\nIt hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can not be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that. Would drugs make drowning less painful?\\n\\nWhat about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.\\n\\nA frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you would not even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.\\n\\nBut what about mom? and grandma? or even Dad, even though I hate him? Or the dog?\\n\\nGod I love you, that subtle way you flirt with these messages, you, laughing at my stupid jokes and me, so impotent, so awed by you that I cannot act. You are beautiful the way you are now.\\n\\nfuck, maybe I will buy a ropeI have been sad for a long time. it is been so long that I can not even remember a time I was happy. I recently told a girl that I had feelings for her. But I knew she did not feel the same. But even still, this is like the most sad I have been for being rejected. I have always been bummed, but I have never actually been sad. And this is the saddest I have ever been for something like that. And being a young guy, (I am 15) I want to say that it is just being a teen, and that there would be plenty of other girls, but I do not want any other girls, I want her. she is treated me better than most of my friends. She understands me. I go to her when I am stressed, and she never complains about me going to her, even though she should. Sorry I am just ranting but really. I do not want money or anything. I just want her. And I just want to be happy. Thank you for readingthat is all I do fail. I look at ppl trying out new stuff and being quite successful but for me no matter how hard I try it is the hardest thing in the world.\\n\\nGaming: failed ✔️\\n\\nLife: failed ✔️\\n\\nPiano: failed ✔️\\n\\nSwimming: failed ✔️\\n\\nTennis: failed ✔️\\n\\nDepressing post I knowHi,\\n\\nI am contemplating whether to go on a consultation for my mental health or not. Honestly I am too ashamed to get seek medical attention, next is the cost. But its taking a toll on me as the days go by especially this quarantine period. So please help me to decide, thank youThe combination of quarantine and getting laid off from my job in the span of a month is confirmation that I do not belong in this society. For several months, I thought I was gradually getting my shit together despite the feelings of hopelessness surfacing here and there. Felt like I was overcoming it. I was even  thinking of planning for the future. Now, I have reverted back to feeling worthless. there is nothing more I want to do than die but I hold on because my partner and family would be sad if I did and I am too chicken to go ahead and pull the trigger.After my girlfriend broke up with me, I cried for the first day but after that I did not feel sad, I still do not and I realized that I do not feel anything else, I feel empty, all I can think of is her, I used to play games as a hobby and now even that reminds me of her, I hate my situation because I know that I am going to be okay, that I will get over her, and that I may find someone else, but I do not want that all I want is her, not someone else.\\nSorry for my rant but I had to get it out have a nice morning/day/night.I have been thinking about it a lot lately.  What would it be like? \\n\\nIt hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can not be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that.

Or the dog?\\n\\nfuck, maybe I will buy a ropeI just think life is completely pointless. The only thing that keeps me here is my fear of an afterlife. When I am with people, I feel even more lonely. I joke around to mask my pain and nobody realizes just how tortured I am inside. I am running out of options.When I say I am ugly, I promise you, I am ugly. there is nothing wrong with saying it. I am just ugly. My sister is the complete opposite, she is gorgeous, skinny, with an amazing body and face. she is literally been hit up on instagram by several modelling agencies. She has over 10k followers on there.\\n\\nThe moment anyone meets here and sees me, they are shocked. Like, what the fuck happened? Me being the sister of someone who is completely drop dead gorgeous and you have got me looking like a deformed man.\\n\\nI can not ever imagine anyone wanting to be with me, my body is horrible as I have lost weight and the skin is just bad. I have got very bad social anxiety which was inherited but also worse because of how I look.\\n\\nImagine if I DID ever get a boyfriend? they would see my sister and think \"wtf?\" like everyone else. I have only ever had a boyfriend online who did not know the extent of how ugly I am bc of my extreme use of filters and editing. Literally I am pathetic.\\n\\nthere is nothing going for me anymore. I have 0 friends in real life and anyone online I talk to does not know the extent of how ugly I am.\\n\\nI discovered yesterday that I actually have an underbite thus making my face appear longer and my chin bigger. it is set me off so badly and I actually do not want to live being this ugly anymore. Everything on my face and body is just fucked up, I have NO good features. Extremely wonky and bent nose, huge chin and jaw, big forehead, too tall, big feet and hands, saggy breasts, sagging skin on my stomach and thighs, lazy eye with uneven eyebrows. I want plastic surgery so bad but in my situation it will never happen. It does not help that I am 6ft tall as a female, even less options as not many guys want a tall girlfriend.\\n\\nNo one will ever want me. I am a 22 year old female who is never even had a first kiss. It is no ones fault but my own but looking like this and my mental issues I just can not anymore...Just when I thought it could not get any worse, the universe proved me wrong. \\n\\nI was doing fine this past few days, I can control my overthinking, I was empty but atleast not in pain, I thought no one could shook me up anymore. Not until last night when we receive the news that my brother has not come home yet and we can no longer contact him. \\n\\nMe,My Mom and Grandma was up all night (I live 9 hrs away from them) we were just notified by my brothers friend at around 11 PM that my brother left the house around 2 PM  to get the money that their employeer has sent them and has not come home since. We can not still file a report to the police since it has not been 24 hours yet.\\n\\nI was not able to sleep the whole night, I was worried about my brother and I was even more worried about my mon and grandma. Just this morning his friend was able to found him, He was caught and was put to Jail bcoz of drugs. He tested positive for the drug test. He live at another and since we have the pandemic theirs nothing we can fo about it.\\n\\nI do not KNOW WHAT I DID TO DESERVE SUCH A MESSY LIFE. The universe can not give me a break.I am a 21 year old female and I want to die. Not because I am too depressed to go on, but because my family is crushing me. My parents had a baby when I was 11 years old. My brother is turning 10. My dad tought my brother how to do an oil change on our car. They never offered that to me. They did not even force me into drivers ed when i was in high school. Now I am an adult that can not drive. I do not have a job because I do not want to rely on my parents to take me to work. Its like they have given up on me and are trying to do better with my brother. However, they only placate him when it comes to things he likes. I genuinely feel that my parents should not have had another kid...I have been battling depression for almost 5 years now, and I have had the gamut of peaks and valleys, most stemming from crippling loneliness and self hate, but one thing that comes with an ongoing fight is the insight that you gain along the way.  For the most part, I know when the voice in my head is taking control of my world perception at least enough to talk myself off of most ledges of pain, but today was different today I went into my bed and straight up just gave up, the voice in my head said “it was ok to just take the L this time and recoil to safety”, and I accepted it without hesitation .  Even at my worst, I have never kinda just thrown in the towel so quickly and easily,  maybe it is the quarantine in a single apartment after 28 days idk, it was just weird to go so contently into a little depression hole for 3hrs.\\n\\nI hope everyone is doing ok out there, pandemic or not, we are all just people trying to stay out of bed.How do people find it so easy to talk to somebody about why you feel the way you do. Like I can say it in my head but I seem to not know how to translate into words. How do I tell my friends that I am depressed and have been for a really long time without saying, \"oh yeah I am depressed\". Or how do I tell my Hispanic mom who does not speak English that depression is an actual thing that affects me mentally and physically and not me just trying to get her attention. This is dumb* i was not depressed as a child but as i got older and started to see my family behave the way they do, i fell into the same trap as them.\\n* my depression is contagious. i have inherited it from my father who is sadly depressed for the last 20 years.\\n* i am 22. my father got depressed because of career disappointment, hardships, family struggle and underachievement. he was devastated when all his hard work went into vain.\\n* he stopped socializing, remains silent, lost in thoughts, blames others, does not take responsibility, panics a lot, no joy, no happiness in life, never travels, never goes out except for work, does not speak much and also gets angry at us if we enjoy ourselves. he makes us feel guilty for enjoying the life and being happy, threatens suicide. it is clear that failure and embarrassment have ruined his self esteem and self worth.\\n* not achieving his desired job had ruined his life. while growing up, i was told that this is my father\\'s \"personality\" by my mother (who is a little narcissistic, blames my father for not getting a good job, always concerned about herself, does not listen to him talking, victim mentality, superiority complex, puts others down, overly criticizing and controlling nature, thinks she is too good for others, in the 23 years of their marriage my parents have NEVER NEVER EVER talked because my mother thinks that emotions are drama and only \"useless people talk about emotional stuff\" and she is too smart and optimistic to get serious).\\n* okay. both my parents are victims of life. while my father is sure rude, but failure kills you and i do not know if i should blame him. mother, on the other hand, is caring but does not sympathize with my father. she thinks of herself as a human while all others as animals. as if she is a victim in every case and others are her enemies. she expects others to behave well, but she can be childish, crying, shouting, and then threatens us that we will face our fate when we have our own kids.\\n* i see that the rest of my family who are successful in life have qualities very different from us: they are self assured, sympathetic, cheerful, good at socializing, take responsibility, think that everything is possible, have large social circle (we do not), encourage and believe in their children, does not put themselves down in front of others, do not threaten suicide, travel a lot, live lie to the fullest wherever they are. they also talk to their children (my parents do not) and encourage them to achieve great heights, when in problems they do not cry and moan, but look for solutions, stay chill and take control. on the other hand, my father goes into panic mode and blames others and seeks help from others for his problems. he stays distant in social gatherings and stays aloof in a corner.\\n* sadly my father has never got help for depression. no one even cares about him and that he has depression. i do not know if even he knows whether he has it. he is done with life. since my mother does not love him and he does not love my mother, their lives are miserable.I really do not know what to say. I do not have any words. I am getting worse. I am not okay.All my life people have made me feel like I am shit at everything that I do or touch even if I love it. In Highschool, I was in soccer and I loved it so much but everyone was so hateful towards me and made me feel like the worst to ever touch a ball, they made me cry weekly and made me feel mentally pathetic and they acted as if they never even talked to me or know what they did, and even in my life\\'s passion of snakes and venomous reptiles, someone said that it is bullshit that I am educated/experienced with them only because I asked a simple question. I just feel so lonely and hated and that I can not do anything right.I have no reason you feel this way, yet it always comes back. The creeping feeling that breathing is just not worth it, that it will happen anyway. I have no reason to feel this way, but... I really have no reason to feel otherwise. \\n\\nI feel like I do a lot just to avoid feeling this way,  but during the night, alone in bed, it hits me like a truck.\\n\\n\"Worthless, useless, you will never be happy\"\\n\\n \\nShut up, brain. Please. Shut up and let me sleep.I went through a horrible breakup a couple years ago. The person I dated was a pathological liar and narcissist, and I have so many trust issues from the relationship. My depression and anxiety have gotten worse over the last year, and seeing a therapist has not helped. I do not have feelings for him anymore, because the guy I liked never truly existed, but it feels like I can not have strong feelings for anyone ever again. it is not that I will not let myself, it is that I genuinely do not find anyone as good as I thought he was... does anyone have any advice for me?If I cannot be happy, then I can at least make everyone else depressed, huh?I remember that the stress began when I was like 15. I could handle it then, things seemed a little brighter. Maybe not swell since I was already suicidal, but it was not this god damn bad. The depression started around the same time. 15, normal time to have depression or anxiety problems as a kid, right? 16 hit and I tried to work on myself, call me a quitter or a failure all you want. I started to hit the gym with my brother to the best I could do. I studied harder. Showered more often, ate less, ate better, tried to explore whatever semblance of a passion for anything I had. I do not want to turn this into a pity party, cuz this is all my fault in the end, I know that, I accept that, but God, fucking, damn. I never gained muscle, never toned, never lost weight doing the cardio. I failed more classes as I tried harder in them, I still managed to smell like shit after I kept clean constantly, I am still a fat fuck to this day. But now I am a skinny/fat fuck. I just watched the scale drop to 199, from 250 back when I was 16. I do not know why but this triggered me to write this. That stress has just built up to such a horrific summit now, at 19. The real world is hitting hard. Two dead end jobs that I have nearly lost due to Covid. Friends leaving me cuz I am too busy. Rent pilling up for the parents who do not care. Got another rejection letter from another school for being too retarded to be apart of them. God it is like there is a fire in my skull all day long, all night long. I have dreams of being stressed. Of being light on fire. Or just dying. Doing anything to make this burning in my skull stop. I do the meditations, the fucking Japanese hand holding thing. I pray and I exercise still, but god, nothing nothing nothing calms me down. Nothing keeps the fire out of my head. I do not know what to do. I am starting to lose it. I can not sleep anymore. it is been nearly two days. I am sorry for a rant post from a whiney bitch but god damn. My therapist will not listen to me so I do not have anywhere else to go.I always worry everyone and being a burden comes naturally to me. it is probably my only life skill.Derealization and depersonalization is fun.Everything just feels hopeless. I feel like I am not good enough for anyone and I feel like I do not deserve anything. The usual shit blah blah you get it. Why does my mind have to fucking be like thisI have posted in this subreddit a dozen times, but never gotten as much as a couple comments, but it still feels nice just to vent, so here we go again. I do not have any real life friends, I have not since high school. I have always suffered from social anxiety, and even if I could muster the courage I live in a small town and there is nowhere to go where you could really meet people. I have my online friends, but I always feel like I value them way more than they value me. it is hard not to feel that way when you have something you would like to say to them, but you feel like you can not because the last 3 messages in the group chat were also from you. I guess it is just rough not having really felt wanted for years now.Was on the verge of the chasm of mental breakdown but someone told me some real good news and it does not really feel good per se, but rather like falling with style into an I am not okay anymore, and i know the good part of this will not last long, and I, after so many years, still do not know what to do about it.And that is not as painful as i imagined. So i continued and made some pattern on my skin. It makes me feel better now.Not much makes me happy....I distract myself with video games and Facebook and reddit.  I lost my business...and after being the boss...every other job sucks. I am not qualified for anything, really. Thought of going to school for a year or two for another shitty job does not appeal. Getting older...no chance of an early retirement.  there is got to be more to life.  Working a dead end, corporate, cubicle, sales customer service shit job for the rest of my life makes me want to die.  At some point I am just going to throw it all in, give it away leave it behind and go on an adventure till my money runs out and then I will be homeless and then?I have been through a lot of shit, and that shit keeps on adding up. My few friends say it gets better but it feels like it is not. I know my friends mean well, but I feel trapped in this bubble of hopelessness, I am seeing how good everyone else\\'s lives are, how many friends they have that care about them, how fun their lives are, and it feels like I will end up dying one way or another before I get to experience thatLike I did for all of them...Why do I want to cry about everything? I mean everything, others success/failure/gain/loss. People giving me praise/advice/hard time/criticism. When I hear preaching. Talk to any family member, Etc. I just do not get it I am crying posting this. 35yr/m married 15 yrs with a 15 yr old daughter. Struggled with addiction in past, still not perfect but night and day from what I was. I feel I have a hard time living in the moment. Sorry I am rambling never sought help/advice/vented, whatever this is.Woke up at 4am to my 18 month old daughter crying because she lost her pacifier. Husband was next to me asleep like usual. He never hears her cry at night. I soothe her, go back to bed. can not sleep. This has been my life for the last few months. I am exhausted but can not sleep. During the day I can barely keep my eyes open. During the day I am working from home like  most people are during this pandemic. When I try to take a nap, there is too much noise going on so can not really get a solid nap in either if I do fall asleep. \\n\\nOn top of that, I have several things I have been dealing with: \\n\\n\\\\- I have depression for which I take antidepressants. These antidepressants give me the side effect of dilating one pupil more than the other and causes me headaches. I wear glasses to help combat the headache. I can not really stop taking the antidepressants because you should never go cold turkey on them. \\n\\n\\\\- I have also been having a thyroid issue. it is enlarged and will need to be partly removed in June (hopefully, if it does not get canceled due to Corona). I have been feeling like I am going through menopause: Sweating, hot flashes, emotional, ... I am 28 years old ... \\n\\n\\\\- Got scoliosis and kyphosis. Used to go to the chiropractor for treatment but since the pandemic I can not and I have been having muscle spasms and pretty bad back pain. \\n\\n\\\\- My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer spread to the liver and peritoneum. She got her 5th chemo a week ago. she is doing well but we are currently not speaking of her being cured or being able to have the operation to remove the ovaries and cancer. \\n\\n\\\\- My husband has PTSD (Army veteran) and has depression. Takes antidepressants as well as I do. No side effects luckily but he is usually quite negative, easily discouraged and likes to game all day every day if I let him. He moved to my country with me and the daughter for a better life and his integration program has been postponed due to Corona. he is not happy having to wait, he wants to work so bad. \\n\\nThis pandemic has me worried. I am always super careful, keep my distance, wear gloves, wear a mask, wash my hands when I come in and use handsanitizer, immediately shower right after coming back and then I allow myself to go say hi to my mom and my daughter (we all live in the same household btw). I am terrified ... What if I picked up the virus but do not know, what if I give it to my mom with stage 4 cancer, what if I give it to my daughter or my husband. I do not know if my mom would survive it in her condition ... So much anxiety ... \\n\\nI would love to hear some tips and tricks on how to be able to get some sleep and calm myself down enough so I do not go absolutely insane. 2020 has been awful so far and I am expecting to see the 4 horsemen and Cthulhu this year at this point. Thank you guys for reading!\\n\\nTLDR: 28 year old with depression, antidepressants causing pupil issues and headaches, thyroid issues, scoliosis and kyphosis, my mom with stage 4 cancer, an 18 month old and an immigrant stay-at-home husband with PTSD would like some advice on how to be able to finally get some well needed sleep!I have been taking 150 mg daily of Zoloft for several months (last September I think is when my doc increased the dosage from 50) now and have also been consistently exhausted almost 24/7. I can function and feel energized for a couple of hours if I drink an energy drink (which I know is a bad solution but is my band aid for the moment so I can get homework done). \\n\\nDoes anyone else experience this, or could it be unrelated?Hi, I am sorry to be wasting your time with some crappy complaint but I need somewhere to dump my thoughts, after this past week I do not think I have the strength left to pretend to smile. I found out the friends I have known for seven years were only my friends to make me feel better, and they all hated me. They sent dozens of messages telling me I am awful and disgusting and things I already thought myself. Every little thing that goes wrong just seems like the end of the world, I can not stop myself from just crying sometimes and I can not trust anyone anymore. I do not know what to do and I do not want to think I have any sort of depression or anxiety but I just can not tell, how do I make the bad thoughts go away, I just want to be able to sleep well again.I am pretty sure I have been depressed since about 4 or 5 years old. I think so because I do not remember ever feeling happy or content as a child and all of my earliest memories feel off somehow when I think about them. I always felt bored with everything and thought that I did not know how to smile. I realized I was depressed when I was about 6. I do not know how I knew what depression was but I knew I had it. I hated myself, thought constantly about dying, suffered from intense loneliness, thought I was unlovable, just wanted to disappear. Fortunately, I have never self harmed.\\n\\nI have never been officially diagnosed. Never opened up about it when it was at its worst. Lived with it up through high school and into college. At some point in high school it got easier, I guess because I started making friends but I just seemed to be incapable of keeping friendships. I used to agonize over losing my friendships or having none at all but now I accept that it is the way life is. People come and go all the time.\\n\\nAt some point in college I finally started feeling better about myself, feeling confident, finally got a girlfriend. I felt like depression was behind me and I had the tools to fight it back if it ever reared its head again. But I never found motivation to do anything with my life.\\n\\nIn the last several years I have maintained a few close friendships because I have felt I do not need that many. But in the last year and a half I lost all of them from separate incidents and in some way I was to blame for each one. And then I broke up with my girlfriend because she was not putting any effort into our relationship. She developed feelings for someone else and realized she never had those feelings for me to begin with.\\n\\nSo now here I am, recently turned 30, feeling like I am better off alone even though I really do not want to be, feeling like my life experiences have now proven to me beyond doubt I will never belong anywhere or with anyone, people are probably better off without me, and I am sad about it all but not soul-crushing sad like when I was a kid. I have begrudgingly accepted it. I do not feel numb. Just a sad sort of neutral. And I have no direction in life, nothing to live for. I do not really think about suicide. I feel like I am just a leaf floating down the river of life, wanting to be more, wishing to have more, but knowing I probably never will. Just drifting along in life.\\n\\nAnd I can not tell if I am even depressed anymore. I have looked at some quick online tests but they are all like \"do you feel like life is pointless?\" \"Do you have thoughts of suicide?\" \"Do you feel sad all the time?\" They feel like the wrong questions. I feel like I might be depressed but it does not feel like the same kind of depression I have known my whole life.Dealing with depression is always a battle. For a 42yo guy like me, I have suffered since I was a pre-teen. There have been events in my life where I almost said \"that is it. I have had it\". \\n\\nBut I am posting to let you know that there is a light at the end of that deep dark tunnel or in some cases sunshine behind that grey cloud. \\n\\nHow I have survived bipolar depression.\\n1. I say this to myself every morning in the mirror: \"I love myself. I love my job. I love my family. I love my life.\"\\n\\n2. I surround myself with light. What I mean by that is I laugh. Laughter not only forces that sour down expression to change. It releases a chemical to the brain that seems to counter act the gloomy feeling.\\n\\n3. I have hobbies. From video gaming to crocheting. I keep busy. \\n\\n4. I have a Rose and Thorn coversation. Rose=the good things. Thorn= the bad things. \\n\\n5. I change those thorns to roses.\\n\\n6. I remember a wise drag queen once said, \"If you can not love yourself, how in the hell you going to love someone else.\" She also said, \"You are your own worst saboteur. do not let yourself get in your own way.\" \\n\\n7. I talk to my mother, who also suffers from depression. We battle this together. \\n\\n8. I find joy ever in the smallest things. Like reading my favorite book or watching my favorite movie. Book=The Chronicals of Narnia. Movie= The Last Unicorn. \\n\\n9. I listen to inspirational music. \\n\\n10. Yes, this helps, I do not know why, but I cry. \\n\\nThe reason why I am posting this is because what is going on this day in age, where isolation and social distancing has become the norm. More often then naught depression is the feeling of emptiness hopelessness, and loneliness. But you know what, it does not have to be. We can battle together. \\n\\nStay strong. We can and will do this together. There is no cure, but together we can push back the dark and let the light shine through. \\n\\nLove you all.I am just kind of sitting idly, unmotivated. i do not enjoy anything anymore and I have one friend. i do not want to kill myself though. I am just sort of waiting.**(20 F)** so basically, I have really bad anxiety since 8th grade, mind you, I am 20 now. Some things recently happened and especially during quarantine I have just gotten worse. I am already a homebody but having to strictly do online courses for uni and being away from literally anyone supportive is hard. I honestly do not have friends and all this time I have been spending it in the same corner of my bed, thinking. Countless nights staring at the wall, I can not sleep, etc. I do not want to admit this but at the same time I am concerned, I have fallen into a really bad spiral. I noticed that instead of worrying about things that could happen (the anxiety part), it evolved into accepting everything bad HAS and WILL happen. I have barely been eating anything for 5 days, even if i try I really just can not, the taste is bland and makes me want to puke, so I do not eat. I try so hard but I can not get past maybe a slice of toast and yogurt. All of my life I have bitten my nails and would stress eat and now ironically, my nails are growing for the first time EVER because I do not have this oral fixation anymore which I thought was okay but I feel like I just lost any will to do anything, including my nervous habits? I know I am mentally getting worse but I am still breaking habits and it is really confusing because I understand the severity of how I am feeling but I genuinely want help, but knowing I am alone really feeding my mindset of just not giving into human necessities. I do not know what to do. I would use to wish I would not eat so much and now that food grosses me out its just making me realize how shitty it all is.So, I am impatient and do not take time in doing anything so here is my short rant. 6 months ago I got a gf, honestly my ideal girl. I did Xanax and went to jail for a day and did not talk to her for 2, it is only been downhill from thr, I suspect she cheated and a friend of hers told me and showed me proof. I want to kill my self because the girl that told me made me feel like I have a small dick. And in my mind I will not feel okay with myself until I fuck a bunch of women, but I am not attractive. I failed, I lost the girl I love. I am 19. do not have my GED, can not get it because of corona, going to go back to high school but do it online. But I have no motivation to do anything. I am not interested in anything. I smoke weed. On and off. It does not help or make it worse. Some of my worse thoughts have been sober. I deleted social media because anything that remains me of sex makes me want to dieZ and I lost hope in women being loyal. I am talking causially on ps4 and this one girl says she left someone of 5?years for someone else. I am done caring. Fuck I may just go back to smokin meth. But really get into it this time.\\n\"Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy\"- Scott Fitzgerald\\n\\nIdk why I am posting this, just kind of felt like getting some things off my chest anonymously. \\n\\nI believe that tragedy, as awful as it is, can lead to a more beautiful life. The great thing about hitting rock bottom, is that once you are there and you can not go any lower, from that point on you can only do two things: stay at the bottom, or rise. \\nEveryone faces hardship in their life, some more difficult and trying than others, whether that be the death of a loved one, drug abuse, family or marriage issues, we all face it at some point or another. \\nThis world is dark and cruel, and it shows no mercy. If you let it, this world will consume you. But if you let your hardships transform you instead of destroy you, you can create the best version of yourself that you have ever been. Tough times make stronger people, and the more resilient you become to this world, the better. \\nIn my personal experience, these last few years in my life have not been very fun to say the least. I had knee and shoulder surgery which at the time disqualified me from the military (which was what I had always wanted to do since I was a kid), My dad almost died from medical malpractice, I lost my mother and aunt to suicide 6 months apart, found out my girlfriend of almost 3 years at the time was cheating on me, went through a horrible breakup, struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, got kicked out of my house several times and slept in my car in an Arby\\'s parking lot, gained a shit ton of weight, and lost some of my best friends. I completely let myself go as a person.\\n\\nOne day I had just had enough of the mental torment I was in, so I put a gun in my mouth. I sat there in my car for hours trying to get myself to pull the trigger but I just could not do it. that is when I realized that if I could not bring myself to pull the trigger then, I could never convince myself to do it in the future. That was my rock bottom. \\n\\nI did not kill myself, but I killed the old version of myself. I decided from that day on to the future, I would work on becoming the person I had always wanted to be, and let my trauma mold me into a better person. \\n\\n3 years later, I have come to terms with the death of my mother and no longer blame myself, I do not use drugs anymore, gained control of my drinking habits, went from being 245lbs to 190lbs and in-shape, and I even joined the Army like I had always wanted to. I gained control of my depression and now live a much better life. Honest to God, I have not had the thought of suicide cross my mind since that day in the Arby\\'s parking lot. \\n\\nThe way I try to look at life is like this: always appreciate the good times and cherish them, because you could always have it worse. do not be in a state of constant self pity, because it would not take long to see someone else that has things much worse. I am sure some of you have had a rougher time in life than I ever had, or could even imagine. \\n\\nDark humor is something that I truly embrace now. Some will say that it is an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I disagree. You can not take life too seriously, you just have to roll with the punches. \\n\\nToday I am thankful that I am alive, breathing, and able to see the world with two eyes and a healthy body and mind. \\n\\nBe your own hero, and aspire to be the type of person you wanted to be as a kid. Use your past trauma to mold you into what you want to be.\\n\\nCreate something beautiful out of your tragedy.\\n\\nPlease share your thoughts and insight, I am always open to listen and learn. Maybe you will help or inspire someone else that might come across this and read it, who knows.What is there to live for without him. Our relationship was on and off for 3 years and I will admit it is toxic. But its us. We scream and fight and then we laugh and feel closer together. Its our routine. Its not healthy, but to be honest he was the only one who was there for me consistently.\\n\\nHe hit me today and i hit him back. But because he cornered me and refused to let me leave i stupidly reported him to the police. they have arrested him and I am regretting it all. I would never take him to court. I hate his guts but love him with all my soul as well. I feel so guilty that I am at home in bed whilst he spends a night in a cell. We were both at wrong. \\nWithout him I am nothing. I am worthless. I doubt he will even want to speak to me when hes released. I contacted the police and told them i do not want to press charges or proceed further. But because of protocol they have to send someone out to me in the morning so hes in there all night. \\n\\nWithout him there is nothing worth living for. No morning cuddles and him comforting after my night terrors. No more late night tv sessions or kitchen dance parties. No more morning showers together or walks home in the dark. I have relapsed and cut my arm up. I think I am going to end it if he decides to go no contact. There is no way i can survive this lockdown without him there. All this pain because i decided i could not put up with his bullshit. Why could not i just deal with the abuse for fucks sake. Its what i deserve. When i think forward into the future i genuinely do not see myself alive without him.Obviously I have to change habits and fight through it but what are some interesting things you guys/gals have done that worked in helping depression ?I want to do group video chats or zoom like everyone else but I have no one to do it with. I have two friends, which both live over 500 miles away. I moved states a few years back and lost basically all my friends. And out of my two remaining friends only one considers me a best friend or a close friend. And I tell myself that I am going to tell her how awful I feel but I never follow through. she is going through some shit and her problems are so much bigger then mine. I do not want to be a burden. I do not want to be alone.This is where it is all coming down, as my bottle falls to the ground, I look around with blurry vision, as my body spirals around. Desperation finds it is way in and this sinking feeling has me pinned, no time for resurrection it is in my head and I feel it winning. they are running under my skin, and I think I am giving in, but it is all so worth it do not you see, the way that you will keep saving me. So I will keep chasing this high, while my eyes disguise these lies, and I can not escape because it is all over for me.After two years of suffering from severe depression I ended up gaining 30 pounds. I do not know what to do. I used to go to the gym and eat healthy all the time, but ever since my decline in mental health i stopped going to the gym and started staying in more. My headspace was “no one cares about me so why should i take care of myself”... Eventually, i beat my depression got the help i needed but I am overweight. Not noticeably heavier but I am not “fit” anymore. I feel miserable and it makes me feel like I might go down that dark path of feeling depressed again. \\n\\nI hired a trainer and after two months i noticed i gained 5 MORE pounds. I ate healthy, I have been working out. What can i do? It feels too late to lose weight at this point ...Dear Echo,\\n\\nI do not even know what I want to say.\\xa0 I just feel like I need someone to talk to.\\xa0 Cliche will not do.\\xa0 What I am feeling can not be wrapped up in that kind of package.\\xa0 I like to be heard and felt and cliche is neither.\\xa0 How can I be so damn lucky in life and still\\xa0 have so many moments of misery?\\xa0 I guess that is the nature of depression.\\xa0 Anytime the pain lasts this long it is bound to happen.\\xa0 What is weird is that we are in the middle of this damn quarantine and that is not what is bothering me.\\xa0 Everyone feels so alone right now and maybe that is what is the most depressing.\\xa0 Nothing feels different to me.\\xa0 Through either self-isolation or a lack of concern from friends I have been alone for a long time.\\xa0 I can not include anyone in this.\\xa0 Not really include them anyways.\\xa0 I can tell them what I have been through with basic descriptions and labels.\\xa0 I can say I have been hospitalized for depression.\\xa0 I cannot and would not invite them into my world so that they could truly understand my feelings.\\xa0 To understand this, one would have to empathetically sink a little into some very dark and uncomfortable feelings.\\xa0 That is like asking someone to voluntarily join you in your nightmare.\\xa0 I do not even want to be in my nightmare, I would never ask a loved one to come with me.\\xa0 There are coping skills for this.\\xa0 Things I am supposed to do that helps me ride out the storm.\\xa0 They give you a boat and oars, tools to navigate these waters, but sometimes you can look right at the oars, feel the boat rocking under you and not have the will, energy, desire to take hold of the oars.\\xa0 Sometimes the water looks like the right and only answer.\\xa0 Just fall overboard and sink as far away as possible.\\xa0 That is when you take the oars anyways.\\xa0 Because you remember.\\xa0 A child\\'s face.\\xa0 A distant memory.\\xa0 Empathy for the pain of others.\\xa0 Even good days when this feeling is almost forgotten.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 My son\\'s first crawl.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 My wife\\'s warm skin.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 My daughters first dance.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 I will laugh at something again.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 I am strong enough.\\xa0 Stroke.\\xa0 There IS value in me.\\xa0 STROKE.\\xa0 THIS GOD FORSAKEN FEELING WILL NOT BEAT ME.\\xa0 STROKE.\\xa0 FUCK YOU PAIN.\\xa0 STROKE.\\xa0 STROKE.\\xa0 I AM A FIGHTER.\\xa0 A GLADIATOR.\\xa0 STROKE!\\xa0 \\xa0STROKE!\\xa0 STROKE!\\xa0\\n\\nFuck you depression.\\xa0 I win.\\xa0 Everytime.\\xa0The smallest things put me down. I feel like I die a little inside every day. I do not see the point in trying anymore. The only reason in still here is because its too difficult to not. \\n\\nSometimes, I wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up. I would be happier there than in my real life. But I am just a spoiled piece of shit. I have so much in my life that others only dream of, but it is not enough for me. I am really a terrible person. Sure I do not go around trying to hurt people, but I am just innately flawed. \\n\\nI feel like I take more from those around me than I give back. I constantly feel insecure. Am I a good person? Do people hate me? Am I just a burden? Am I a selfish shit of a person?\\n\\nthere is something wrong with me. I do not know anything. I have no ambition. I have no desire. I just want to play games all day.\\n\\nI can not do anything correct. Its never enough. Its never good. I am never good. I am wrong.\\n\\nI do not know what to do. I am overwhelmed. I just want it all to stop. I just want to be happy. Please.The situation is a little hard to explain, but I will sum it up as fast as I can. I started dating someone in High School who had a lot of issues. They were heavily abused as a child and had just no understanding of normal- or how not to be violent. I stayed with this person. I saw the person behind the rage and I knew I liked them, but I was young. When I graduated I moved out to go to school in the same area he lived in. I moved in with him. He proceeded to destroy me. From my confidence to my self worth and my trust of other people. Piece by piece he picked me apart. He reduced me to numbness, to isolation.\\n\\nBut here\\'s where things get a little more interesting.\\n\\nAbout six years into our relationship, I told him I could not take it any more. After countless nights of sitting with him while he cried, coming home to find him half way off the balcony (We were 17 stories up), being screamed at for not doing the dishes, being yelled at for just not understanding, having things thrown at me and being kept up until 3am most nights when I worked a 6am-2pm job six days a week, I just could not take it. I told him I loved him, but if he could not go and get help and figure this shit out I was leaving. We had a huge fight, but the following day he asked me to make him a Doctor\\'s appointment, because he was too afraid. He got anti-depressants. Things started to change.\\n\\nit is been almost eight years since that fight. We are still together. He changed himself completely over that time. Went to therapy, got a handle on why he was treating people the way he did. it is been a couple of years since he had any major issues, and I am definitely much happier. I am very proud of how far he is come. The amount of work it took for him to get where he is and the battle he faces every day thanks to the things his awful family did to him is humbling. It offers a certain amount of comfort, knowing I was enough to change for. But there are a few issues.\\n\\nI went through all of that with him. We have been together about 12 years in total and friends for over 16 years. I was not about to make him go through that horror all by himself. But in the process, I have done myself so much damage. I have horrific memories of that abuse, including the few times he got physical. His rage caused a lot of black outs, so he does not remember most of it (I need to make it clear, he does not use this as an excuse. He has owned up to everything I have told him about, and he knows there is more). The problem is more or less me. Every time I tell him about something, every time I tell him about a fight we had or a time he made me really uncomfortable, the guilt he feels is very clear. He tries hard not to get too down, because he knows I don;t enjoy making him sad, but he has a lot of regrets from that time.\\n\\nThe issue has become that I can not talk to him about it. This man has been through 13 years of physical, sexual, mental and emotional abuse. He has dealt with all of this once before. Coming back through it with me is just re-triggering things I do not ant to see him go through again. he is tried his best to be supportive, but between the fear I gained of communicating with him over the first part of our relationship and my concerns about his mental health, I can not talk to him. But over the course of helping him, I distanced myself from my friends and family to keep them safe and to better contain the situation. these people also do not know the extent of the things that happen and I do not want them to think about him that way. He really is a very mice person now, having worked hard to be that way. But knowing what he did, most people cannot look passed it.\\n\\nI just do not know where to go from here. I have no one to talk to, but these memories are eating me alive. I have scared all the time and when I panic I get sucked back into those moments. He asks me what is wrong- I just can not tell him. I can not sleep, I barely eat because I feel ugly and I am constantly frustrated. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, I have 2 herniated disks from the aforementioned full time work and I have a brain injury that causes extra mood swings and cognitive issues. He cares for me, he helps me and he keeps things clean. He tries, but I am so wrapped up in the past I have a hard time even getting involved in our new relationship. I am not sure what to do from here...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I super appreciate all the support but I need to note for clarity and to avoid too many repeats: As stated above I am disabled and thus unable to work. I do not have any money and my partner is currently in education to get a decent career to support us. We live on about $1000 a month, plus food donations from family. So right now, I cannot afford therapy. We have considered both therapy for me, and couples therapy but cannot currently afford it. When he went through therapy I was fortunate enough to still be employed and had a decent benefits package that allowed for that for my spouse. I lost those benefits in 2015 when I was laid off from the job that allowed for those things, and at the time I Was dealing with his issues and so did not go through my own healing.I have let it go too long between trims (like a few years now) and with my already existing depression combined w corona stress my hair now has several large clumps I am having issues with :/ I am embarrassed to be asking this on my main bit I need adviceI am feeling lonely, numb, and exhausted both mentally & physically with some flashbacks that have been haunting me for almost two years now. I should be over it by now but I am not. \\nI lost all of my online friends but that is probably my fault since I am very shy, reserved and I find it difficult to maintain friendships..\\nI guess that is all I have to sayNever been on Reddit before, but I do not know where else to turn. Anything I post on my social media accounts are completely ignored by everyone. I have no one to talk to. I feel like no one gives a shit. My best friend is in a different state and super bad at texting, so having an actual conversation with her is pretty much impossible these days, I have never had the kind of relationship with my parents to where I feel comfortable talking to them about anything really, I am not in school and I have extreme social anxiety so I have no way of meeting people my age, and making online friends has always felt weird to me, I get along with my coworkers but I do not know them well enough to confide in them and I am too scared to try and get close to them, and talking to my therapist just is not the same as having a friend. I will probably never date because guys have never liked me, and no one would ever be able to put up with me. I have never even had a real relationship so I do not know how to. And like I said, there is really no way to meet people my age here, and dating apps scare me, not to mention they are only for hookups and I hate hook up culture. So basically that is why I am here. I literally have nowhere else to get everything off my chest and I feel like it is killing me. This is probably going to be pretty long so I will be shocked if anyone actually reads through it all.\\n\\nI am 20(f), turning 21 soon. I went to college for a year before dropping out, and shortly after my family moved to a new state. I thought it would be a fresh start, but instead I am cut off from everything I ever knew. I got my first job last summer, it pays well, but the living cost where I am is ridiculous, so I can not afford to move out. I have no real skills and have a difficult time completing/understanding the simplest tasks, so I know I will never be able to have any job other than minimum wage service industry, and I absolutely would not be able to handle the stress of a second job. Because of that, I am afraid I will never be able to move out. I can not afford to move out on my own, and finding a roommate seems impossible. You have to pay for every single roommate finding app/website, and like I said, I have social anxiety, so I would have to know someone extremely well to be able to live with them. I am also a more conservative person, and every person my age, (especially in my area) smokes weed, drinks waaay too much, and is very aggressive about politics (I do not like talking about politics to anyone, not even people I trust). I also have no credit score, and no renters history, so idk how I would get an apartment even if I could find a roommate. \\n\\nLiving with my parents is becoming a living hell. They treat me like a child, and always have. They do not listen to a single thing I say, they do not understand me, my depression and anxiety, or even really seem to try to. I have not been able to grow up because they will not let me. I pretty much do not know how to do anything myself, and I can not ask them for help because they tell me I should teach myself, which I have never been able to teach myself anything. I did my taxes for the first time this year and they had to walk me through it. I can not budget. I do not understand the stock market, or credit scores, or anything at all to do with money. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety because Idk what to buy. I will be covered by their insurance till I am 25, but I have no idea what I will do when that happens because Idk how to go about choosing insurance plans/companies. I have a hard time making appointments for myself because talking on the phone gives me extreme anxiety. I do not know anything about politics. Trying to learn any of this is just so overwhelming I can not handle it and I just shut down. So basically I am actually just a fucking child and there is not a single thing I know how to do.\\n\\nHow could there possibly be a future for me? I am stupid, do not know how to do anything on my own, will never be able to make more than minimum wage, will never be able to move out, can hardly take care of myself, can not make friends, will never find love. I do not know how I can have any kind of life worth living. I feel like I will be living in my tiny bedroom in my parents house, single with no friends until I die. I feel so pathetic. I do not know what to do.Job? \\nUnemployed \\n\\nFamily?\\nToo depressed to care for them\\n\\nEducation?\\n 7 years of my life “trying” to get a degree, but just wasting money\\n\\nFriends?\\nAlmost everyone is gone, I do not know if I drove them away or they just were not my friends all along\\n\\nMental state?\\nTrying to ignore having depression with weed  \\n\\n\\nI just do not know what is going on, I just feel that people hate me for no reason which makes me get away from them. \\n\\nI just want to be alone.\\n\\nI know I need help but I just can not ask for it.\\nWhy? When I was a kid my parents “taught” me to never ask for help, and I know that this is not a valid excuse but I just do not know how or care enough to change \\n\\nAt this point I do not know what to do, I just do not have some to talk to, and even if there was someone, I would be too afraid to talk.Get ready for a rambling paragraph of sorrow and confusion.\\n\\nI only have one friend which is my best friend, that I actually talk to and I think they want want to get rid of me entirely because I am an embarrassment. She does not deserve to put up with my shit and i feel like she is beginning to learn that. If she goes I will not have anyone like that close to me who I can go to talk to. I have never been in an intimate relationship, I want someone to unconditionally support me but I will never have that because I will not let myself have that responsibility. I will just tire out the other person until they want to leave. In my brain I am a grotesque creature who does not deserve any sort of recognition or thought from another human being. I say the stupidest things without thinking all the time and it always puts me in deep shit. I feel like every hour of the day is just a ticking clock awaiting for my body to crawl into bed and never get up the next morning because I rather stare at my ceiling and wait for it to cave in, only to have a sharp piece of wood puncture the part of my brain that controls emotion. In the unlikely event that would happen, at least I will feel something else but self pity and endless dread. I feel alone. Just alone. I feel like I should not be here anymore. I do not want to kill myself, I just do not want to be here. I mess everything up. I am not good at anything. People tell me I am good but I am not I am not I am not I am not. I am just not. I know I am not. Fucking remove me from existence. I am such a waste of air, I do not do shit with my existence, I do not deserve it. I just want to go into my brain and dig all the shit I do not like out of it. WHEN WILL IT END?so after my OD I have had heaps of meetings with therapist\\'s and stuff and they are all pointing toward putting me in a psych ward or as they say \"mental health unit\". Does anyone know what it is like and what i should expect?At this point living to old age and dying a natural death feels like an “achievement” thoughts?I feel no acknowledgment of my depression, even after I tried to commit suicide, not even from my mom.\\nI have been taking antidepressants, but with this quarantine I am just down all the time, I feel so lonely and believe me, I have trying to reach out for ages, but after every attempt I feel disappointed, as if nobody gets it, nobody is there, even when it all comes to “cuddles in bed” days, I have nobody to cuddle with, nobody to share thoughts with, nobody to just sit there with.\\n\\nI do not know what to do, I am afraid of being alone in my head, I am afraid ALL THE FUCKING TIME.\\n\\nSometimes the only really relaxing though is that I can always end it all.\\n\\nLoneliness is killing me.\\n\\nP.S. I am touch deprived, since I was a child, with no actual physical relationship with anyone. I am 26, and I do not do “just sex” relationships.I just moved out for college in January, my girlfriend dumped me after ignoring me for one or two weeks right after that. So that plus the loneliness of not being able to see my friends and not telling them because our relationship was kind of a secret turned into really bad first weeks of college. I was really sad and could not make any friends except for a girl who started talking to me.\\n\\nI have had moderated depression for a couple years now, went to therapy for a couple of months last year but my mom could not pay for it anymore.\\n\\nSo I started college kinda bad but kept getting worse, I could not keep up with the work. I was happier because I made a friend, but just her. I really want to but all the time I think people are just nice and they like me but just not enough to want me around. \\n\\nThe second week of March I was at my worse ~~yet~~. I needed to finish a paper so did not attend to biology lab, couple of days later did not do the work needed for chemistry lab, so I lost that practice too, next day, turned on an incomplete homework, even when I had all the answers. I just could not bring myself to do it.\\n\\nRight after that quarantine started and I came back home, now with online classes. But since then, I have started getting worse and worse, I do less work than I did before, I can not get up of the bed, I can not bring myself to do anything, can not sleep either. I just do not want anything but disappear, I am not even sad, I just feel empty and lonely.\\n\\nIt may look like I am just lazy or irresponsible, but I really feel something is happening to me to be this bad.\\n\\nI am seriously thinking I need help as soon as possible, I have tried to start by myself but is just not enough to keep up with school.My depression is situational. I am 28 i have a baby and my main goal and dream is to move out and be independent. But I am stuck with my parents and they are not making it easy. \\n\\nMy mom i feel uses me as a bank. So i got my refund. She asked for 500, another 500 and more and more until I had absolutely nothing.. Then she needed 300 to turn the cable on and I sais ok but i needed it back. Even the the woman over the phone said it was sweet of me to give the mo ney but my mom had a problem of me asking for it back and had an attitude and basically threw the money at me. \\n\\nMy dad just made the situation worse saying she does not appreciate you and stop letting them walk all over you. My dad then took my accessories off the key of the car my mom and me got and threw it on my bed. My mom basically took over the car.  Bc i was working bc of maternity leave my dad accused me of laying up on my mom but before then i always paid the insurance until i could not. \\n\\nEven when i was in college with every refund I had i always gave my mom 600 always. \\n\\nBack to the tax refund she wanted me to give my bro an extra 300 ( gave him 1k for letting me stay with him)i said no bc i do not have that much left and she started shouting and threatened to leave me at my brother\\'s and take the car... \\n\\nThen both of my parents talked abt me loudly in my presence to friends or fsmily members..\\n\\nJust recently my dad accused me of being a bad parent when i had my son laying on his back for half a sec and he cried while i went to get clothes to get dressed. \\n\\nThen said you are going to be on welfare forever and the night before i saw a woman wearing a nice blouse anf my dad said I can not wear that bc I havr a stomach and the day before that said I still looked pregnant. \\n\\nMy mom said she wish she left me at my brothers.. And i just do not know what I am doing wrong except existing. \\n\\nI am not even looking fwd to my stimulus money.. My mom already factored in 500 from my stimulus but ofc she is going to ask for more. \\n\\nI have been looking for work and been turned down each time due to this virus... \\n\\nI just feel like id have to deal with their crap forever. \\n\\nI never get lucky like my friend that got a good paying job in the midst of this pandemic and has a good hub that works.. \\n\\nI also have hpv anf got lucky enough to get not one high risk strand but 2. 16 and 18 that because cancer. \\n\\nI have no friends. Never had. Lonilness is the theme of my life.. \\n\\nIdk i want it to end. I kind of thought of a good way to go. I just feel I have no one. No one at all.  To help me through my issues.  I am just like man what if i had ppd?  I would have killed myself for sure desling eith all of this. \\n\\nIdk just hopeless. I will never leave my parents. \\nNo opportunity is opening up for me.I think I will just make it permanent. I just do not fit in with others and it is better just to stay away. Only socialize enough to make money and get food.I was in college for a bit but I was going through OCD and not knowing what I want to do in life and could not do college. Since than I have been in therapy, went to Colombia for six months and than came back to the States and got help for my OCD. Now I have been better and I tried to go to a culinary school which it had a hospitality program and the course was 6 months. I only did two months because I have been going through anxiety about doing group work but was nervous and I got paranoid easily. I have been in therapy for my social anxiety and general mental health stuff since October. I was looking for work than COVID-19 came and my plans got hold back. My mom bought me plane tickets to go to Colombia in August with her to spend a month there. Hopefully we can go due to this pandemic but now it is look it is what the future holds for me for the next few months and after I return from Colombia in September. With this pandemic, I do not know what I want in life. I want to get better and stuff, but since I have no work experience and basically dropout out of college in 2017. I feel like I am alone and ashamed.Anyone else feeling depression due the situation? My country belgium for 7 weeks in complete lockdown. I can not cope with this. Fitness closed. can not get drunk with friends. can not tinder meet. I feel very lonely. what is the point of keep breating?Just curious. What would be the fastest and least painful way to suicide?\\n\\nI have learnt to tie a noose a while back, and I got scared because I knew it could be long and painful, any easier ways?This quarantine period has been beating my mental health like a jackhammer to a piece of rock. I miss contact with my friends and I can not even sleep without crying. My friends are the only people I feel super emotionally safe with and I can not even be with them. I think the worst part about not being with them is that I think I am forgetting how they look. Life seems so dull and pointless all the time now and I just dunno how much longer I can keep this going. I feel like shit all the time and I hate it. I got animal crossing and that makes me feel a little better but only very briefly because I end up remembering that I am so distanced from my friends that I have to resort to videogames for any source of happiness at all. Anyways that is all I needed to say.Everything is so dull. I can not find one single thing that has any sense of meaning to me anymore. \\nI have tried to get better but nothing I do works. Seriously, I am worthless and can not do anything right. Maybe I am just not meant for this world anymore. it is so tiring. I am so fucking tired.I am sick of constantly thinking about myself and wondering why other people are not there for me and feeling forgotten. I do not want to be greedy for attention. I want to think about someone else other than myself.Mid 20’s male who is just done with life. I have been working on being sober but life just keeps fucking me. I would love nothing else to drinking myself to death. I am pretty sure I have been close as I drank a whole bottle of whiskey and a whole bottle of vodka in less than 15 minutes and spent the whole night throwing up bile. I am just so done with life in every aspect and I guess this is just my way of venting. I am sorry to disturb you all. Peace.I am so tired all the time... I barely even have motivation to eat. it is so hard all the time. I have just started eating peanut butter and drinking tea. I am nearly sure I am malnourished, but what is the point? I am not doing anything. i hate this.I am fairly unintelligent, I lack talent, I am terrible at socialising and I am just tired of failure. I feel like sticking around is causing a slump for everyone else in my life, especially with this pandemic going on haha. I do not wish to add any extra baggage. \\n\\nI really do not want to die just yet, I do not intend on living a long time but I at least want to try a little more before my light goes out permanently.\\n\\nI just do not know what I can do anymore. I do not know.About a year ago my life started going downhill, I noticed everything positive I did had a negative impact in my life. For every good there was a bad. I talked about it with friends and they have always told me \"that is Life\". It was really frustrating.\\n\\nEventually, I got to the conclusion that if there was no good in my life then there must be no bad. I have family issues at home and I started ignoring them. At the beginning this mentality worked, but now I have gotten into a point of no return.\\n\\nI feel I can not be physically happy anymore, I have such a negative mindset that I try desperately to change but can not. I only find comfort in video games and series, but for reasons relating my family\\'s view on these hobbies, they have been restricted too.\\n\\nI am in a hole I can not escape and I feel trapped, and the corona virus is not helping either, locking me with my parents forcing me to handle their problems. It is really frustrating and I do not know what to do, I desperately want a change in my life. I want to be happy but I can not, it is so emotionally draining... I was so stupid for rejecting happiness. \\n\\nSorry if my English is not that good, my first language is Spanish....Just one of those days, I even tried to change my mood by watching a childhood movie (the little princess) but that movie plot triggered some very bad feelings I have deep deep inside about not having a father (or mother) and being raised in a very abusive family...I can barely take care of myself. With this fucking useless unemployment line is always too busy, and fear of getting a job at a place that still operates due to the novel coronavirus, having another living breathing thing to feed, but not really knowing how that is going to happen, has been an increasing stressor on my mind. Before it was not a problem because feeding one cat is not expensive at all. Now I am kind of worried about both of us.\\n\\nFuck this shit. I do not want to just rely on. Charity and the kindness of strangers, not do I want to rely on anyone else really. Life just fucking sucks. It is too fucking uncertain. There is nothing good about having to worry about your next meal. And then you have to also worry about a second living thing. I do not understand how anyone does this. How anyone would choose to have fucking children. How anyone could possibly be happy and motivated in the face of complete uncertainty. I do not want to learn how. I just need to die. But I am too much of a fucking coward. I just want to give up. I am fucking tired of this fucking virus. Fucking tired of worrying about accidentally killing myself or a family member by fucking bringing it home. \\n\\nIn life you are just fucked if you do, fucked if you do not. There is no real safety. There is no real security. Everything is fucking shit, and I wish I had the ability to have life in me despite that fact. But I fucking do not.(figures i would try this out because I am pretty much incapable of doing anything else to helpmyself)\\n\\nhate to say the typical \\'dead inside\\' stuff...but man all i ever feel is usually anger, and depression...only have 2 family members that i talk  to(can not avoid it) and its always about how horrible things are EVERYDAY yet if i tell em its getting me down...i get treated like I am a horrible person for saying so, the rest is work a job with people who arnt exactly decent people(trying to word that nicer than it really is I am not even exaggerating) because its the only job that almost pays all the bills, can not get another one or better because of time conflicts with what i have to do to help my grandfather, and no friends to speak of...i thought i tried to make a few but it was always just...seemed wrong to try with them, they always turned out to be just unhealthy to be around or just wanted to do stupid things like sitting around talking crap about people, or go to bars and have no responsibility for their actions(drunk driving, acting degrading to themselves and to other people, ect) not very big into religion more out of a respectful thing because my family is not exactly on good terms with stuff like that...i think my problem is just too much tv, comics, books, movies, ect because i tend to get jealous of the fictional stuff i see, more just ways that seem like things that are kinda based on reality, ya know seeing people happy, or even the crazy stuff like hero ideals...except I am stuck doing everything i think is just generally pointless, i also tend to look at the state of the world and humanity and I am very worried for the future of literally everything so I am down because i can not do anything to make a pointfull change for that and i do not see anything or anyone else being able to do it either...its just a daily routine of work, think about how things are(100% of the time its not good thoughts) go home listen to the same things i was thinking about all day and more to add to it, finish what I am told to do and just sit around distracting myself with games, comics, and movies because its the only way i do not hear my thoughts, yet i do not want to ingore them...it just feels wrong to ignore the bad stuff becuase its like that is what i think is the worlds just causing its problems from anyway...i do not even know what I am looking for lol, i guess a bit of happiness/ways to change things not for myself for the planet in general(a bit stupid but my only bit of religous thoughts are that humans should be guardians of the planet and of its history and life so that we can repay the fact that were all really just lucky how things are set on this planet...it could be so much worse... if anyones even reading this thnx lol\\n\\n...i have no adrenaline...no postivity to act on so really just trying things is a hardship in general, just caught up in fantasy ideas that make normal life extreamly boring while hating how the world and humanity is turning out..just pretty much a walking puppet with anger...hoping i can find a way work with my own depressing personality \\n\\n(btw i do appreciate all suggetions but I have looked into so much it seems like i can not find an answer....also i just can not beleive in taking pills or therapy(mostly on how little money i have on that therapy thing) and the area i live in does not provide really anything for the type of person i am...mostly for retirees, and just...bars i guess really nothing else not that i have the time or funds for anything else than what I am doing right now...srry all 1st and only post I will make about depressing stuff...do not need to make things worse on other people ya know?I see, well talk to, my psych and my therapist tomorrow. I am tripping balls I guess. I have not really been sleeping. I cry pretty much every day. Everyone who is ever said they give a fuck about me left me at one point or another. Now I am alone. Here at home from college with my abusive family. I do not see any point to anything. I do not really know what to do or say to my psych tomorrow. I do not really want to die or anything. I would rather just bang and punch a bunch of walls till I can not feel anything and then do it again when I start feeling shit again. I am so fucking tired of everything.I have so much bottled up from over the years and it is just getting worse every day. I have nobody to talk to. All my friends gave up on me at this point because I avoided everyone for so long. If i were to try talking to anybody about my feelings it would just be a burden on them. The only way I can let anything out is here anonymously. I just need someone to tell me that it will be okay..(Trigger warning/mentions of self h*rm/suci*de)\\n\\nMy life is pretty downhill, my first 10 years of my life were bliss but after that it was shit. I move a lot and could never form any deep connections until middle school I found my platonic soulmate she is so amazing and I love her sm we met in 7th grade but I had to move again after my 8th grade year, I used to cut pretty regularly in 7th and early 8th grade, but stopped after she helped me through it and I was so mentally happy. But when I moved I fell back into self harm and sucidal thoughts began to swarm me, I missed my friends dearly and I was all alone again. Then I met someone, I was new to highschool and when I walked into my bio class I caught the eyes of a guy. let us call him J he was also in my art class we gradually started talking, and I even started to feel happy after a long time. He then confessed to me, I felt so happy I felt so validated and loved..But we did not last, I really thought we would last but no. It was so painful seeing him turn around and walk away. Like everyone in my life they all leave, no one lasts forever. Since then things got gradually worse and worse, I have two goals in life and it is to experience true happiness and love. But I do not think I will ever experience love, I do not believe in it. Love has only ever brought me bad experiences. But all I want is love, hugs and validation... But I give up in those concepts after all the other shit in my life that I did not mention happened I have become closed off and distant I have not let love in my life since.Title says it all I guess. I just need a place to vent right now. I am not sure how much longer I can go. I have already tried killing myself twice. Third time is the charm, right? I just can not keep living like this. I am a closeted (sorta) trans person living with an over-controlling, cyber-stalking, conservative family. They treat me like some sort of object they can do whatever they want with. When I show signs of not being some submissive pet or when then possibility rises that I am not cis they flip out and we have yet another fight. Fight and fight and I just can not take it. I am sorry to burden anyone here but I just needed to vent. Kinda hoping no one sees this tbhI will been doing good with my depression until today where I just want to to die. The irony thing I am week out from video chatting with my therapist. I just hate my family and hate that I am stuck with them and I wished committed suicide back went I had the chance. And it is not like I can not do that now but I would rather commit suicide alone . And not even like everything going is getting to me it really the people keep saying the same old shit like they can not believe what is going is happening and finding to blame someone for it.Hi,\\n\\nI am 29 yr old straight male.\\n\\nAbout me:\\n\\nI   have always exceptionally done well when it came to education,  hobbies,  career or money. Have always ranked as one of the more extreme  INTJs. I  moved to US 6 years ago, to build out a career, did masters  here from  one of the toughest schools, changed careers and am working  well where I  am greatly appreciated and regarded. However, I am feeling  that I am at  the lowest point in my life, and I would really  appreciate any help. I  need some \\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\\\_.\\n\\nHere\\'s what happened in my life chronologically in last 10 years -\\n\\n2013 - graduated as a mechanical engineer, was little unsatisfied with the managerial job I had\\n\\n2013 - also got the ongoing acne condition, which has refused to go away until now.\\n\\n2014 - but confidence was still high, decided to go for masters, moved to US and change careers to design\\n\\n2015   - moved to LA, made a lot of new friends, but my social confidence  kept  going low, while I did great in work and education. People used to  make  fun of my looks and inability to ever find a girl. Started  smoking as  well regularly\\n\\n2016 - I believed I was just sexually frustrated, and I started letting guys suck me off, just for some quick relief.\\n\\nThis continued slowly until I graduated and moved\\n\\n2017   - Had a couple of girls who liked me online in between, did not work  out  with them. Started smoking weed a lot, over weekends mostly, would  stay  high most of the weekends just to forget and go to work. Started  living  alone and moved away from these old friends thinking that they  were  toxic.\\n\\n2018 - My sexual   frustration got higher and higher, and I am ashamed to admit, but I just   liked anyone looking at me for validation, and I was ready to do   anything to please them, even though I know I am straight. But I guess   it was just desire to be accepted, may be not. I was also frustrated   because I was not able to quit smoking or start to improve my life. I   felt stuck.\\n\\n2019 -  Met a girl   through work, and this time I really fell in love. Gave up smoking, all   wrong stuff, had started working out and finally got first phase of   surgery to fix my acne problem. Also picked up hobbies, got very good at   them as well.\\n\\n2020 Jan -  This   year has been the hardest. My best friend died in an accident. I found   out that she was lying to me all this time, cheating with her ex   boyfriend and she was not even sorry. Even then I tried to help her.\\n\\nFeb - Thins started picking up again, she said she felt for me until she dumped me again. 4 times she dumped me in total.\\n\\nMar   - I got so frustrated/rejected that I went and got so high that I let a   guy fuck me. I came back drugged and texted cheating-ex for 10 hours  straight calling her all kinds of names and abuses and threatened to put all her cheating texts online.\\n\\n1 week later - One of my ex-friends who I had a crush on, fucked her bf   in front of me (knowingly/unknowingly which she was high). To forget it  I  got high on mushrooms for the first time, and I had the worst trip,   where all the time I just felt disgusted with myself and my life. And   none helped me, while I begged and cried in front of them.\\n\\nI   made a resolve to never go to those dark times again, and started   working out again, but I was still very angry and guilty about my ex   even though she cheated. I felt utterly humiliated and undeserving of   such a treatment. But could not deny how I talked to her so started   apologizing to her again. I was feeling peaceful again until last week. I   tried to contact her to find out if she was okay during corona   outbreak.\\n\\nLast week - she   contacted me again just to tell me that she is blocking me again. She   did not even change and I felt she was trying to hurt me again. She told   me that she saw that I was worried but chose not to reply. And somehow  I  lost it and abused her again because I was utterly scared for her  life  (she was in Italy). I have started smoking again, and am not able  to  move ahead.\\n\\nI feel like I have  hit  the rock bottom in my life, and I am starting to lose hope. I am  locked  up alone in my room, no flatmates or anything, just 4 walls, and  just  staying here, I feel more and more attracted by the dark side  rather  than positivity. I know I was never good at managing my  feelings, but  anything to help would be very helpful at this point.  I  feel stuck in a  loop, getting dragged into the darkness. I do not feel  like eating, nor have any motivation to do anything.  I feel guilty of  abusing her again, But I feel angry for her having cheated on me, and  scared and helpless to move on if I fail again. I begged her to help me  but she left and I have no one to talk to about this.\\n\\nThank you, and sorry for long post. \\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\\\_This is just a rant, I need to really get all of this off my shoulder a bit. Any help would be appreciated :)\\n\\nThese past few weeks in quarantine have helped me relax and not have to constantly worry about school, but I had no friends in school anyways so I have no body to talk to or play games with. I am always so lonely, bored, empty and sad, but I do not want quarantine to end because then school will start again and then I will start getting even more depressed and get panic attacks once again. Anxiety is already rampant when I am trying to sleep (racing heart, chest pain, sleep apnea,) this all happens every single night when I am trying to fall asleep.\\n\\nI am also always super self conscious because I have been told that I am ugly and stupid by everybody I have ever know in my life. Now I have to always hide my face and can not even look at people in the eyes in case they look at my face. Doing any activity is also challenging because I lack any motivation. I keep missing multiple online assignments from school. I always keep judging myself for anything i do, there is always a voice at the back of my mind telling me that I am worthless, ugly, stupid, talentless, that I should just kill my self and end the suffering, and I really want to.\\n\\nAll i would really want right now is someone to hug me and let me tell them about everything, my parents are mega religious so they always just pray for me, and since I am atheist it does nothing to help me.Quarantine has been an enlightening experience. I am trapped in my home with little to do other than course work and it leaves me often alone with my own mind. Trying to hide my struggles from people around me is getting old. I want to act happy and I want to act like every day is a good day, that whenever I talk to my S.O, I am happy, when I am with friends, I am happy. \\n\\nI can not help it. I feel like such a burden. I feel like no matter what I do, I will always be the source of someone\\'s anger or sadness. \\n\\nI feel it everyday. I feel myself slipping back into the hole I have been desperately trying to crawl out of and I do not know what to do. I feel a gaping hole in my chest and it all hurts. All of this is a pointless fucking ramble that I will probably freak out about and delete again later. \\n\\nWhy is depression so damn hard? I do not even know if I want to get better anymore. I know recovery is not linear in any way shape or form, but the crashes are just too much. I rather stay this way than have hope again. Fuck, it all hurts so much and I am suffocating.\\n\\nThank you for listening.I do not feel like exercising. I do not feel like going for a walk. I do not feel like writing a rap because I am depressed. Idk how to do something when I do not feel like it like it like I feel lethargic.i do not like opening up to people because I am so scared of coming off as whiney or something, and I have been bottling up everything for so long and idk who to reach out to anymore so here i am ig haha ! so basically nothing feels real. i do not think I am experiencing derealization (maybe?idk tbh) but forever I have felt so disconnected and so distant from everyone. not like, oh I am so different and quirky no one understands me hehe, but like no one in my life feels like they fuxking exist. i feel like this will not ever change, I am waiting for something good to happen but i think and i do not even know what I am waiting for. suicide used to seem so selfish, but at this point i feel like i have nothing to lose. my friends are so distant, my family is so distant, but i know that if i ever killed myself i can not imagine doing that to my sister, but at the same time it is like my brains convinced me that nothing is real anyways or i should not even give a fuck because everyone dies at some point. I have never even told anyone how absolutely disgusted i am at my appearance, specifically my face and “acne” which i know is not bad but at the same time i can not even look at my face without dimming the light a little bit taking off my glasses or crying a little and it is become such a big insecurity and it will not go away. I have tried reaching out to friends and my mom but it makes me feel so much worse knowing that even those people can not make me feel any better. I am so tired I am so so tired of literally just fucking existing, and i mean everyone can relate to that ha but, i do not want to wake up tomorrow. i just want to be finally happy and feel good and feel “there” ig. but it is like i keep spiraling into a bigger mess i just do not know what to do anymore. anyways haha any fun tips ?13yr old male(14 in legit 11 days) and I just feel like it does not make sense for me to be having all these thoughts and problems. I cut myself a lot sometimes daily, drink, have suicidal thoughts, little to no energy all the time, have trouble in school and socializing, and my home life I do not know if it is abusive or not but it definitely is not good.  My friend once said after I made a suicide joke \"ew you legit sound like a 14yr old girl\" and I have just been thinking a lot about how maybe I am not depressed and just an overreacting or attention seeking teen. I feel like all my friends hate me and I am just annoying to them. I am scared if failure and stress everyday about what I am going to do for my future and how I am going to make it. My parents divorced when I was 9 and both of them got cancer around the same time leaving me pretty much free at both houses because my 5 siblings either just never talked to me or were at collage and my grades started improving and I made some online friends because I did not realize how much my parents try to control me and push their views onto me until now. I also realized neither of them give a shit about me as a person but just want me to be there so there and do everything for them. I do not like venting to my friends because I just feel like I am annoying them but sometimes when I hit a low I do so anyway and when I come out of it I just feel really bad for venting to them. I have tried suicide twice by hanging myself but both times the object I was using to hang myself from the ceiling broke or felldown. there is a lot more problems I could talk forever about but I do not feel like my problems are bad enough for me to be feeling suicidal and I feel like I am too young to be thinking life is hopeless and to be having frequent breakdowns.\\n\\nTo sum up: I am very depressed and self harm and drink and that stuff but feel like I should not be having these thoughts because of how young I am and feel like my life has not been bad enough for me to feel this way\\n\\nSorry for any spelling or Grammer errors and I hope everyone reading this and on the sub has the strength to get through another day I believe in you all!!so I am losing weight. it feels good. I am going to have a flat stomach before the summer if I keep this up. unfortunately I can not go to the gym but I ran today and only ate one very small meal. I can not wait to finally see myself in the mirror and view myself as someone conventionally attractive. I deserve it. and honestly I can not wait to use that attractiveness to get ahead in the world, for people to finally look up to me the way I deserve to be. in anything you do, it is half about how you do it and half about how bad the people watching you want to fuck you. that is just the way of the world. I feel like i could do so much more with myself if I would just get up to normal people standards. right now I am ugly, I am brash, I am awkward, I am unconfident and my voice is weak. I am squishy and fat and these things I can change about myself. I am changing them about myself.\\n\\nthis year so far I have learned what capacity I have for handling bullshit. I do not tolerate it anymore. I do not tolerate being manipulated. I do not tolerate people who cross my boundaries and act like they know better than me what is best for me. I have been abused my whole life into listening to other people\\'s opinions and needing their attention and validation to keep me wrapped around their bony little fucking fingers. in truth I do not really need much socially. I do not know why I had so many problems being lonely when nobody ever made me feel good in the first place. everyone\\'s shallow and everyone\\'s a liar and I have been too naive to expect more from anyone, but it is not their fault. I would hate me too. I do hate me... but not for long. not for long, world. I am going to be on top of this shit show and nobody\\'s going to fucking stop me. I am a sociopath, through and through, and I am damn proud of it.People have huge problems. The world has even bigger problems. Things just do not go right. Anywhere. \\n\\nPeople struggle with tough situations, hunger, poverty. \\n\\nThe world is corrupt. Losing resources. Gaining greenhouse gasses. \\n\\nBut I can only think of all the things I suck at. The things I can not do. will not do. The people I do not know. will not know. The so much better people. More thoughtful. Talented, outgoing, smart, funny, nice, caring. People. \\n\\nEverything sucks. Especially me. But I only care that I suck. Maybe because I think I can change it. Or I just hate it more. \\n\\nI just can not explain it. I do not like myself.I have not wanted to admit how low I have been. I have been trying to cover everything up. But I am drowning. Listening to Mac Miller\\'s \\'Good News\\' an amazing song that somehow encompasses how I feel. I feel broken and I am trying to figure out how the hell to get up. I feel so alone. I do not know how to start over. Not right now.I went prison at the age of 18 for 18 months for something I got tangled up in but was innocent of but that is not even the reason for me constantly feeling down. it is my older brother passing away when I was 16. I feel like life/society has not been fair to me. I do not want to call it depression to have respect for those are actually have clinical depression but for the past 3 years, I cannot remember a day when I have not contemplated suicide. \\n\\nI have checked websites for advice but to be frank, they do not sway or benefit me. Any advice? What should I do?I am I 26 year old female and have been battling anxiety and depression for 10 years now. I did not really have a good high school life. do not have any friends, I have a few friends in and out of my life. Have only kissed 2 guys in my life once 19 and the other time 25 I was extremely drunk only had sex once and never been in a relationship. I paced around my room from 12-25 listening to music with my headphones on, still do it sometimes but not a lot. And do not know why I can not make connections with anyone. And the worst is not only that I have not been in a relationship with anyone I find out that a guy I like likes me back but I am to scared to open up to him and maybe see if anything will happen between us. I think I am pretty much set on just being single for the rest of my life. I quit everything I do I have no motivation, I am pretty much scared of everything I feel like I am mentally disabled. I love make up and went to cosmetology school but never did anything with that I feel bad for having my parents pay all that money and I never did anything I still work at my families restaurant I can not be a waitress because I backed out of that last minute because of anxiety.\\nI had such hope for my life and wanted to get off this track I was on for so long now I am just done. \\nWhat are people thoughts, should I just stay on this track and be happy, I mean we all live different livesI really can not comprehend the fact that there are people just walking around with no mental illness or trauma. What is that like?I (16m) who is adpoted do not think I have seen any signs of love or affection toward me from my adopters. No hugs or kisses or smiles. They provide for me and do not abuse me, but other than that they are just there. My \"dad\" drinks a lot and my \"mom\" is always out with her friends. I had really good friends that made me feel good but literally at the same time they all became obsessed with drugs like 2 years ago and will not talk to me anymore. I do not know if I have any cousins or siblings to talk to. Idk what to do this makes me really depressed. I feel like I have no one to talk to and will never get a hug or feel like someone loves me.I am 21 years old, I have not finish high school, I cry for every little thing, I can not speak with my family, I have hurt the best person I have ever known, I am losing my battle. \\n\\nWhat can I do?something about my friend saying that just irked me to new levels. i can not pinpoint exactly what it was that sent me into this fit of rage and sadness; it is probably either because I have tried my hardest to fight against my depression and to survive for my friends’ sake rather than my own, yet here they are... taking it all for granted and provoking me to try harder to die? i mean, people fucking shoot themselves in the head and jump off bridges but still end up surviving. i feel like the fact that I have even risked something that very nearly killed me (but, instead, sent me on a luxurious trip to the ER) should have already been concerning for anyone who cares. but, i guess what I have realized from this sentiment is that nobody really cares. it is such a shitty reminder that i somehow managed to fail at both life and death.\\n\\ni did not have any words to say back to her. I am hurt and revolted. it all makes me want to die even more.so I have wanted since 5th grade to fall asleep & not wake up & i do not find living particularly fun & my mom got help for depression & anxiety for around 2 years & I have talked to her & apparently our symptoms are similar in lots of ways but she does not think I am depressed because I am only sad in the afternoons or sometimes the school day & sometimes i get really up & things are fine so she does not want to take me to at least see (also therapy is expensive)\\n\\nam i fake depressed or like just sad & suicidal & that is a normal teenage hormone thing or actually depressed bc I am probably being dramatic but I am sick of being sad every day even if it is just the afternoonsMy life is going pretty bad. I lost all my friends and I am about to lose my bf who is my only friend. I really hate the way I am, I am a very horrible person and cry every night.At the beggining, I am sorry for any text mistakes, english is not my main language. Now, should i start taking antidepressants? What is it like taking them? My therapist offered me some time ago that i could, but i did not want to, I am scared i will not be myself, plus it kinda reminds me of all sorts of drugs and I am generally scared of drugs and things like that cuz i had problem with them in the past, I am afraid I will again become too dependant on them. Also, anyone else going crazy during quarantine? Every night I am getting small panic attacks and i just HAVE to go on a walk at like 03:00 in the night, drink a beer outside and smoke half a pack of ciggaretes or i feel like I am going to hurt myself or something. Also, my tooth hurts like hell and i can not do anything about it right now, cuz dentists are closed (fuck you coronavirus) and I am afraid I will get addicted to painkillers. Is this even a thing? Becouse i think you can get addicted to anything. Sorry for a long rant, not even sure if this is a good place to post this lol.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the replies, i think I will talk some more about antidepressants with my therapist. And about my tooth, i had some operation right before quarantine started, now it will not get worse when it comes to medical aspect, it will just hurt till my dentist finishes treating him. So i have to wait, nothing else to do.I did that. I made him go. I broke him. He was my friend, then he became my brother. I wanted him to be there the day i got married. Now we are strangers again.  I deserve this but he did not. People should stay away from me.(20F) I have been on antidepressants for 2 years, I used to have a high sex drive and now I just really never do and it causes problems in my relationship from time to time. My boyfriend is understanding and all but I feel bad that I am just never in the mood for anything anymore.\\nI do not want to stop taking my meds yet, it has made a noticeable difference and I do not think I would be able to be where I am at right now if I go back to before I was on them. I guess I am just wandering if anyone has any ways to helpI lost my job. Am socially isolated. can not find meaning or purpose. do not know when this will end. Have no hope for the millennial generation. Think Trump is the worst leader this country has ever seen. do not want to wake up until things are normal again ... that could be a year or more.Not much of my life has changed since this quarantine. I have 0 friends but now since I can not go anywhere I am just stuck at home with my toxic family with no escape. Everyone\\'s saying how they miss their friends and can not wait to see them again. I have no one. I will still be in my bed every weekend drowning in this pit of depression and loneliness by myself :/I see people always give me weird looks like I am some sort of creep.it is 3am and I can not stop crying so sorry if this is not the place but there is nowhere else I can talk about this. My therapy is cancelled now thanks to covid when I feel like I need it more than ever.\\n\\nI constantly try to be nice to everyone. My way of living is being nice to everyone no matter what until they give me some reason not to. Whenever I see any of my friends struggling, be it a tweet or a Snapchat story they have posted, a message in a discord server, whatever, I am always the first person to be there telling them if they need to talk I am there, and sending encouraging messages. When this covid situation started I could tell it was causing a lot of stress and unhappiness for some of my friends so I bought resources and spent 2 days making little care packages for my closest ones. I baked brownies, and made handwritten encouraging notes, and spent £30 posting them all. Doing good for others makes me feel happy, but I can not help but feel sad when even a fraction of that does not get extended back to me when I need it most.\\n\\nMy first boyfriend was extremely abusive, which has left me a bit traumatised since I did everything in my power to be good to him and was, imo, a good girlfriend. I spent half my wage flying from England to Ireland to see him every weekend / every other weekend when he never even came to see me like. When that ended my friends were very supportive, which was nice. I guess that is why I wish they were supportive more of the time, instead of it being such a rare thing. My sister and brother are 2 years younger than me and are in great relationships which I can not help but envy. I am their older sister yet I am a lonely unlovable failure. My best friend of 14 years died a couple months back and I still feel the impact, I kinda blame myself tbh, but even then when all my friends knew literally none of them except my other best friend extended so much as a \"hope you are okay\" until said best friend went off on them (we are all in a discord server together) pointing out that I am always there for them. And right now, I am going through a deep depression realising I care for everyone but very few people actually care about me, as once again none of those friends I am always there for have said anything, and I am wishing I could just stop existing, because no one seems to want me to anyway. \\n\\nFrom growing up with kinda crazy parents, to being abused and raped by my first bf who was supposed to love me and now these friends who can not even put in a tiny bit of the effort I do.. I feel like I am just here to make everyone else happy and to suffer in silence on my own because no one actually cares at all. I have hobbies and interests, I am starting a diploma next week, I am not totally hideous and I have been told I am funny multiple times, idk wtf I am doing wrong at all. I always message first and put the effort in like I am supposed to. I am starting to think I am just fated to be alone forever.\\n\\nAnyway this is really long and no one is even going to read this anyway I just needed somewhere to get this out. If it were not for my dog depending on me I would probably be strongly considering just offing myself by this point. I am so very tired of trying to convince myself it will get better and my efforts are appreciated. They never fucking are. Thank you if you actually read this. I appreciate you.My school year at college was going alright, until I had to move back home from campus due to corona. Thus am I now in a bad home environment for my mental health (nothing serious just its not good for me being home), that with the combination of online classes, and the feeling like since I am home I do not have schoolwork, have all lead to me being demotivated and thus falling behind on stuff. I have some 3 or 4 papers that are late and some other 3 assignments that are due or whatever idek atm.\\n\\nI can not really be productive, at most I get some work done but usually get tired after doing my daily routine and not much gas left for actual school work. Also my sleep schedule is a bit off but kinda fixing that, and again, home is not a nice place for me so I tend to stay up later than usual cuz its the only time there is peace and ppl rnt here in my house.\\n\\n Any tips?I am taking Latuda and Lexapro and I have never been dumber or more apathetic. I can not concentrate. I am easily confused. I am so. God. Damn. Slow. My mood is great and I am not really depressed, but I am as sharp as a sack of wet mice. I have fallen WAY behind in my schoolwork, but I just feel, \"Oh, well...\"\\n\\nAnyone else? Has anyone figured out how to cope with it?hi, everyone. a bit emotionally upset atm so apologies if this post is messy and long \\n\\ni met this girl in sixth grade. well, more like I got a crush on her but I never got the guts to talk to her. after a semester I had to move to a different middle school in the same district so I thought I would never see her again but for some reason I still held out hope. \\n\\ntime passes and high school comes around. it is 9th grade and I am in English class, talking to acquaintances, when I see her. long story short I get her Snapchat and we become friends. hooray. after a few good months of being friends I confessed to her. we got into the talking stage and I was so happy... maybe too happy. me being a 14-year-old who barely knew how relationships worked I was far too clingy and after about 3 months she broke it up and started dating someone else. I felt awfully because it felt as if I had been cheated on but after some time I realized why she would have done that.. we stopped talking for a while. \\n\\nSophomore year came around and after a good 5 months of self deprecating I was slightly confident that things would turn around. would not you know it, she is in my Gov class. we did not talk right away, but it was so painful seeing her and then seeing them together. one day I get a text from a random number asking who i was. I return the question. it is her. for some reason i was okay with being friends. honestly, i had those feelings for her and after not being able to take it anymore, I confessed to her. obviously she was in a relationship so nothing happened. but those were a good 3 months of friendship. \\n\\nafter a few months of crying myself to sleep, summer finally comes around and I start working a bit on myself. talking to girls. junior year came around and I was feeling okay for the first time in a long time. until I walk into my algebra 2 class and she is there. I go to my lunch and I see her. a few months later I get a Twitter dm. it was her. she wanted to see how I was. we talked for quite a bit and became friends again. I still had most of those feeling but accepted she was in a relationship so I tried to not pay them attention. anyways, after around 2 months her boyfriend finds out about us (he knew about our ‘history’) and told her to stop talking to me. so we did. about a month or two pass and we talk again. I can not remember how, exactly. anyways, he finds out and breaks up with her. she blames me for it and we stop talking. a few days later she texts me saying how they got back together. she keeps on saying it is ‘toxic’ but she wants to be with him. anyways, we stop talking for a good while. this was like November (I think) and she texted me on the holidays to wish me happy holidays. January comes and she says how they broke up. he had cheated on her. we talk for a few days and I realize I got to act on my feelings so I do and I confess. after talking it out we realize we both want to make it work out so we do. we are on the talking stage again and it is all good for a few weeks. until she tells me she is been hanging out with him. I ask her to please stop because not only do I feel uncomfortable with that, but he has brought so much misery into my life. she refuses, so I end things. a couple of weeks pass and she texts me. saying how she apologizes and wants to make work things work out again. I told her I would be okay with that as long as she will stop talking to him. she says no, which was a huge red flag that I ignore. for some reason, perhaps out of fear of being lonely again, I tell her as long as they do not hang out or talk *constantly*. we go for a few weeks and it is really great. until she tells me he was going to go pick her up. it was like 11pm. I told her to please not go but she said it was okay. after a night of feeling miserable I woke up and waited for her to be up. when she was, I asked her how it went. she told me they kissed. I ended things right there and then. \\n\\nLast week I was texted her at around midnight. I had received a text from her that apparently was delayed a few weeks so I asked what was going on. we talk about everything that has happened between and somehow we both still want it to work out. I tell her again that she can not hang out w him if she wants to try again but she says she can not because now he is in her friend group. I ask her that then she just does not talk to him and then she says she will not do anything. that apparently I am the person she wants. she tells me that maybe we should not start anything right away because she needs some time. I tell her I am okay with waiting for her (I was not). one day in the morning she texted me the image of a pregnancy test with a faint second line asking me if there was a second line. I immediately ask her if she had sex and she tells me she did ... this is during this whole quarantine thing so I have not seen her in weeks. she does not tell me who it was but I am pretty sure who it was. anyways, we stop talking. \\n\\ntoday I was going to walk my dog as I usually do when I see the two of them by my house (she knows where I live) and I almost broke down crying. why? why does this have to happen to me? I think I was talking to her out of fear of losing her and being lonely but i do not know. I am just usually so lonely. I have tried talking to other girls and things just never work out. I do have friends and my family situation is okay but this kind of stuff breaks me, especially because of my age and how much importance there is in these kinds of things. I do not know what to do, honestly.hello“Where is the lamb that gave you your name ?”\\n\\nGone, the waves took her away. Drowned under the blue sky, the memories of you and I. Do not tempt me, for I am breathing under these chains... Let me go, little lamb.Ever since I was a little kid I have always wanted to play in the NFL and having played football my whole life made me think maybe I would really accomplish my goal. I guess life had different plans for me because one injury ended my career and got rid of my scholarship and future. So one year after the day I was injured I am thinking why do I have such a longing for greatness if there is only one thing I have ever been good at and it is just suddenly been ripped away from me. I am at a stalemate with life, if football was not what I was meant to be great at then what, I have never had any other passions or dreams. Does everyone feel this way, the longing to work as hard as you can just to feel like you accomplished something in life. I do not know what is next in my life and truly that is one of the scariest feelings I have ever had. To not know wether or not my life will be worth nothing to me when it does end. Or will I have achieved my internal feeling of want and longing. I do not know what to do or what to pursue anymore but this feeling is eating me up inside and I just want to get rid of it...My girlfriend has been struggling with depression during this COVID crisis.  she is out of work, feels like she has no purpose, and is stressing without her structured routine, social life, and income. I have been there for her through it but I am afraid that I have done some harm with the way I have handled it recently.  We spent hours in bed the night before Easter and talked about her depression.  I will be the first to admit that I do not know what it feels like so I did my best to empathize and point out that everything is going to be alright and that there is support in her friends, and of course all our love. The next day I went home and then was texting her throughout the day.  I told her how happy she makes me to be alive, and how great I felt because of the people that surround us. I told her that she was my family and that through the highs and lows there is always love. How fortunate and lucky I am considering the circumstances of the virus.  She took this horribly and said that I ruined her day and now has asked me to leave her alone.  Reflecting on it now, I can see how she may have interpreted this all negatively although I had the best intentions.  I feel so guilty for making her feel worse, and that my expression of love and care can deliver the polar opposite response. I guess I am coming here to ask for the advice of others who have experienced a relationship that has/had a depressed partner.  What did you say and how did you say it? How do you successfully navigate depression and support your partner without making them angry with you? Forgive my ignorance if what I have said to her is exactly what you are NOT supposed to say.  I am not sure what to do...I have been dealing with depression for most my life and it is kinda ruined my life. I have tried therapy and pills but I can never shake it. Even though its ruined my life I still feel terrible about suppressing the depression, I see it as a part of me and as who I really am, like that is the real me. I am curious if it is normal to feel like that is who I really am?The reason I love the night is because there is no notifications, no parents yelling, no lights, it is just calm and quiet. I can breathe and be all alone with my music and my thoughts.I run through the grass,\\ngreen with envy,\\nto catch up with my shadow. \\nIt brings me to the beach,\\nin which I step,\\nonly to find the waters shallow. \\nThe light in my eyes is slipping away,\\nas the breath in my lungs quiver. \\nThe darkness within is caving in\\nand sealed in the cold I begin to shiver. \\nThis game is moving way to fast \\nand I can not keep up with its pace. \\nNobody is coming back for me,\\nand it seems I can not win this race.\\n       - thanks for reading:)16 year old male here \\n\\nI have suppressed my emotions to the point where I do not really feel them, it was great at the start but now it is awful I can not connect with people feeling now and it makes me question myself.\\n\\nAnybody have tips on how to get them back?A few significant things in my life are not quite right at the moment (on top of covid,) and I am falling deeper into depression even though I have been trying not to for months. I really value resilience and mindfulness, but I am currently in a situation that has no immediate solution and it is eating away at me.\\n\\nAs it gets worse, I am noticing that it seems like my low energy levels contribute to a sense of less agency and control over what I do and focus on, like there is a piece of my brain/emotions (like confidence and joy) blocked off from my perception that I forgot how to access, and like I am forgetting who I am, what I have accomplished, and what makes me actually feel joy.\\nWriting helps but I forget what I write so often, and I forget to make time to journal, and I forget to reread the helpful things I have written. \\n\\nThe brain fog makes this feel like one big memory block.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice or steps to help overcome these things? \\n\\nI have anxiety too that contributes to my struggle with focus and memory but my depression is definitely getting past the mild point and I want it to stop and feel like myself again. I feel like an out of touch stranger. I want to feel like I am useful with a purpose again.The Worst Part\\n\\nConfusion time:\\n\\nThe worst part about my depression is that I have no reason to be depressed, and the fact that I am depressed may be a feeling that I am giving to myself and I am the reason I am depressed. However, that, in itself, is a symptom of depression. Fun.\\n\\nThis isolation is really not fun, but it beats having to live. Hello, I would be very grateful if you could help me, recommend studies and tell me anything related to helping someone that I really appreciate, no matter what it is, but related to the physical it would be of great helpSo I have been with my boyfriend 6 months and its been tough due to the fact i have depression. He is a lovely man and tries to help but he does not understand what is going on in my head. For example, he will tell me to list 10 positives about myself because that will immediately work on taking away the negative thoughts and I have tried to explain to him it does not work like that but he just thinks i can be fixed quickly. Does anyone have any advice on how to help their partner understand their mental health?? No matter what i try i end up feeling worse and feel like the bad guy because i just do not know how to explain itI have made zero friends in college and I honestly from the bottom of my heart believed that my internship colleagues were my friends. I opened up so much to them, did the absolute most to overcome my anxiety and approach them first, and I thought they enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed theirs. \\n\\n\\nOn my birthday I got some “happy birthday xoxo” and was over the moon and felt good, so life was like WELL. I THINK THE FUCK NOT. \\n\\n\\nToday is this girl’s birthday. she is been in this internship for FOUR MONTHS. I have been in it FOR OVER A FUCKING YEAR. Everyone sent her HUGE ass messages, like “i love you so much you are so lovely i miss you we are so lucky to work with you” “you are such a nice and beautiful person inside and outside, I wish you the best, let us hang out soon” and ooooh boy, what a reality checkSo much thoughts coursing my mind.. months of solitude slowly deteriorating my mental health, feeling more and more alienated as the days pass by, each blend into one. All this running around, I can not fight it much longer. Something’s trying to get out and it is never been closer.I have felt good for a while - almost two years. \\n\\nBut this fucking quarantine, I can not work, I am home with kids, and it is all creeping back.\\n\\nI resent my husband. Hate my life. Mad at my kids.\\n\\nI logically know I have the tools to stop depression before I hit rock bottom, but I am tired of fighting it. I would rather let it win. I am tired.\\n\\nI have been doing all the things that normally work - getting outside in fucking freezing temps just for a little sunshine, doing loads of yoga, eating well and taking supplements, saying affirmations, meditating, putting my phone down.\\n\\nI am just so tired.So My depression gets really bad then it kinda lifts and I feel happy and away from the bad thoughts and anxiety only to stop what I am doing  to actively get better because I feel I am! I find myself quitting therapy when I am in a better spot but it does not last and when depression comes back I am real bad again maybe worse! Anyone else? I have had 3 sessions so far and reached out for help and had the first appointment during a bad depressive episode but as the episode is temporarily lifting I find therapy kind of unhelpful because I am not in the head space but I know it will return? it is confusing and I wonder if anyone else had this thought or experience?Well, to get started, i feel like really lonely person. i have family and friends that i think  i care them, but  constant feeling of the opposite. For a long time, i have inability of really express myself, trying to be what I am not for no disturb anyone, and getting so stressed about what i can say.    \\n\\nfor the past two year, in  wake of an abussive relationship and big depression  with suicidal thoughts because of the pressure of my situation, and get really better for a while. But unfortunately i end up get back again of a feeling of emptyness and no expression of myself, losing my goals and interests in what i care. \\n\\ni try make changes but i failed all of my attempts of it, ending worst, starting to smoke and drink more that i should, losing good frienships i getting away of my family.\\n\\nI am tired but also lost, so i do not  know if it is a good idea this, in the end i only wanted to express sincerely what it is in my head.\\n\\nsorry for the misspelling it is not my native language, and i new in reddit.Taking magnesium. Fish oil. Meditating. I am on the last 25 mg of Pristiq (down from 150). But its XR and they do not come in any lower dose. And my psych and I agreed I am so low in pristiq adding another ssri like prozac more so helps getting down from high to low doses. We both kind of agreed to just rip the bandaid off, but the nervousness is terrible.\\n\\nAny other ideas to help me push through this?My bf & I have been dating for several years now. Every year during the fall/winter months he becomes depressed. However, in the previous years it was not that bad. He said that he is had this since he was younger and he just recently opened up to me about it. Now looking back I can see a common trend to some of his actions.\\n\\nThings in our relationship have progressed a lot over the last several months/year. we have both grown together and learned from each other. we have spoken bout marriage, kids & a future. \\n\\nLike every couple we do have our down moments. he is a very fun & friendly guy. Due to some past experiences, including with him, I have trust issues & that leads to some discussions but we always overcome them. \\n\\nOverall, we are super fun loving, we vibe so well, we joke, we have the same social energy & it is great. he is not from here & we are both not from the same ethnic background so we do share some cultural differences but nothing serious.\\n\\nI am writing on this for the first time because I really am at a loss & am seeking some advice. Nearly a month ago, he broke up with me bc he said he was feeling disconnected with a lot of things, people & feelings. He can not find a connection with anything & there is a lot going on in his mind. He has become such an amazing person over the last several years & he always thanks me for the growth that he is made & the love/support that I give him. He said that this break is solely about himself and working things out. He does not know how long it will take & does not want me to just sit around & wait for him while he is trying to figure things out; he thinks that would be selfish of him to ask of me. I told him & tell him everyday that I am waiting for him, I am supporting him, I love him & whenever he is ready to talk/open up, I am here to listen to it all. \\n\\nWe still talk everyday & chill weekly-ish but he is trying to distance himself so he does not call me terms of endearment or act fully normal with me. Some days I get insecure & think that maybe this is about him wanting other girls. He always reassures me that it is not about that & that if it ever came to that, he would tell me but really all he is looking for is to be alone & work on himself for right now.\\n\\nI try to stop getting upset over my insecurities & pushing that onto him but it is hard. He is still so understanding & reassures me as much as he can while he is going through this. I feel bad bc I want to be there for him as much as possible & I want him to open up to me so he can heal. I would love more than anything to be together with him again.\\n\\nDuring this COVID-19 quarantine, I see he is struggling to keep his mental heath up. He says how he wants to play sports or see his friends or even just go to class so he can get out of the house a little. he is more of a homebody but he does enjoy going a few places & being around people. I have suggested working out, reading a book, making a puzzle, painting, playing video games... literally everything & he does do some of them but he is struggling more now since it is been a few weeks at home.\\n\\nAny advice on what I can suggest for him, actions I should take on how to make things better or anything that will help (both his mental health & our relationship)?\\n\\nThanks in advance (: Stay safe!\\n\\nPS: sorry this was so long, I wanted to give some backgroundDo your friends critique you for being too quiet or weird/creepy and then you start to open up more and they still critique you for being annoying/weird? Lol there is just no winning for me. I just stick to very small talk now. Mostly quiet.

I am just so frustrated why did my sister grow up right and why did I turn out so wrong. \\n\\nShe has so many friends, she is really sociable and outgoing, she is really affectionate towards my parents. While I stay to myself and get so damn uncomfortable when I have to open up to anyone especially my parents. \\n\\nThough we did move towns when I started middle school and me figuring out I was transgender and being stuck in the closet. Combined with the fact I was in a completely new school and lost all my old friends contributed a lot to my depression. While my sister hated the old town we lived in and for her moving was a fresh new start. I basically hit my lowest point in life. (But freshman year is when I was able to come out and transition and I have been so much happier and came out of my she will a lot more.)\\n\\nI do not know i feel fucking pathetic, i do not deserve too have as many scars and suicide attempts. I mean people cope in different ways, my sister was a lot more emotional and rebellious than I was. I still feel like I was overreacting. Is there just something wrong with me? Am I just sensitive? I feel like I grew up wrong.\\n\\nTLDR: Me and my sister grew up with alcoholic parents, we went through similar stuff. But while I grew up depressed and suicidal she grew up outgoing and positive. Was I just too sensitive to handle it? I feel like I grew up wrong.So my best friend and I had fought a while back like we just stopped talking because I got mad at her for telling my sister something private but then I thought we worked things out but a couple weeks ago she just blocked me on all platforms and when I saw her at church and asked her about it she just shrugged her shoulders so I told her I was done with her bullshit and walked away and ik i should me sad about it but I do not feel anything about it. Which really worries me because I am afraid that my depression is getting bad again.Okay, I do not know where to start from this, but if there any spelling errors I am sorry, because the tears are covering my eyelids. But I guess I should start with the fact that I am not normally a suicidal person but the though has been crossing my mind whenever bad moments come and go since August (me moving in with my dad) and I am also not just some edgy guy looking for attention, but I honestly do not know where else to go. I can not even tell if this is my way of coping, or if I think some magical solution will come from this. But I am desperate. So one problem I have been having is with myself. it is not that I have everhaf trouble making friends but it is something else. I can not pinpoint it but I would make friends at school because imbalone. I have never actually walked up to someone to befriend them I have always just sat by myself and people came to me. Yet I was still a really outgoing person I just did not how. Kind of pathetic for someone who has been to 7 different school because of moving huh? So I am already a guy with not a lot of friends. But the main place I made friends was over online gaming. And I have met so many people that I know have changd me for the better. And i had thisnone really close friend named joey, I met him while playing rainbow 6 and we became good friends since. Bit then shorlynafter I moved here I was told by one of our other friends (who was close to his half brother) that he would commitednsuicde. And that was the first big death I have ever had in my life. AND IT WAS ONLINE and in still thinking back to wether or bot I could have done somthing to make it better because we were just having a blast on overwatch two nights begore. I know its bot my fault and that his family was mourning so much more. So i told everyone in our friend group to send his mother our condolences and it turned out okay.\\n\\nNow indont know the character limit on reddit so I am going to keep thisbshprt. I am mainly just sad because I habe no form of control in my life right now. I move to minnesota with my dad with 4 other little brothers on is 11 and does not do any of his chpres and gets away with it he does not even feed his animals (beong two cats turtle and a lizard). Ones 9.amd has some learning problems, so he hets leniency, but that is fair. And the others who are 6 and 3 just run around messing up, stealing food from the kitchen, allowed to curse for some reason. And all of this haappens while they are under the watxh of my dad and step mom. So I the oldest at 16 have to clean the whole kitchen, that my step mom perpously messes up and allows my brothers to get away with eatimg in there. And the one that put me into this mess, cleaning the EMTIRE downstairs. So my dad and stepmom jave been sleeping down here for the past few nights with my little brothers (6&3) and they are supposed to go upstairs and sit in their bed by 8. But for some reason, they have been allowed to ait dpwn here with them and MESS UP THE PLACE. The parents are sitting there breaking their own rules by bringong all of these quilts and covers downstairs, Nd bringing tons of food and drinks. They also just let my little brother get all of these chips and drinks spilled all over the place. And then they just do not clean ot up... This has been happening for the past 3 nights now, and I began to get sick of it. Zince I am cleaning up after MY OWN PARENTS, and no ome else is doimg any of their chores at all! My little brother (11) is not cleaning his room or the upstairs bathroom, and my otger brother (9) ismt doing his room or the dinong room, amd getting away with it. And i get my xbox taken away because MY LITTLE BROTHERS WHO do not EVEN LISTEN TO THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THEIR CHORES??? And since I am supposed to be the \"big brother\" and clean up after everyones messes, and constantly tell these little rats to do what they are supposed to, and apparemtly act as the damn house maid 24/7. Just to get yelled at for doing a parents job... So later today, I tried to confront my dad softly, since the day befoew he asked me if everyrging was okay, and if I needed to talk about anything. And thatbtime i said no. But today i try and ask him \"dad, if you and my stepmom are here watching these kids, can you make sure they do not mess up\"? And at first he said \"yeah\". Keep in mind that this same day, my stepmom said no games for anyone because she finally decided to do something aboutbthe kids not doing their chores, but it did not make sense for me to be in trouble since i do not jave a SINGLE grade under 97, and my kitchen amd downstairs have been spotless (but my dad told me it was because I was not makomg the kids do their chores as i said above). And i guess she ran her mouth at my dad, because that is all he was saying when he started getting mad. So he literally just got mad because i politely asked him to not let the kids mess up.\\n\\nSo then, he decided to beat me...\\nI was just so shokes, and to thin kbaout it is starting to make me cry again because i can not believe that the one man i used ti look up to, just beay me over a situation so rediculous. And this was only the second time it happened. I remember about a month ago he was on the couch woth my step mom, and when i walked by he asked me about wheyger or not i had any friends. And of course i had some ao said yes, but I think some thoughts began to spill out of me because I did not cry, but tears started to fall. And so my dad asked me why I was crying, and once I said no reason, he punched me to ground, and started throwing punhes at my ribs that later went into him slamming me onto the ground.. All because I was sad about my sacial life.\\nAnd of course there is a lot more to it, but I am just so sad right now because there is nothing i can do, i can not talk about it because i would risk of making my dad or stepmom mad, i can not vent with any of my friends because I am not allowed to, and i do not want to do nothing because I would just go back to being a complete house maid. amd its not cleaning that is the problem, it is the punishments i get for not making the kids do their chores, or for not cleaning up after them roght. So I am just lost as to what to do. Um just here contemplating running away, or flat out suicide. But I do not know what to do if I run away, simce I do not want to steal food and mess someone else\\'s life up. So there is just suicide and the only thing stopping that is the fear of what could come since it either eternal nothingness, or if religion tirns out to be true, eternal damnation. But I am afraid that once I am pushed over that fear, there would not be any going back...\\n\\nSo please, if you know of ANYTHING i can do, helpI have been doing mostly good during this whole quarantine, most of my depression comes from the anxiety I get around other people. But looking back through my pictures it really sucks to see how sad I am. Like, I deserve to feel good about myself. But looking back through, literally a few years of my life, all I can see are photos of myself with a depressed look in my eyes. It scares me to see that. I could easily slip back into what I am so used to. Depressed and isolated..\\n\\nI have not been seeing my therapist since the quarantine. But mostly because I felt like I was okay just staying home. Idk, it is just sad to see myself in so much painSo basically in 2020 my depression has started to become major, or at least I feel like that is the case. Everyday I have been feeling down, and have felt a lack of motivation and a decrease in energy. I have been feeling huge amounts of guilt and remorse, and I have started to fear the passing of time, and change in general. I find my feelings really hard to explain, as there is quite a lot behind it. I want to see a professional about it, but I can not really because I would have to tell my parents I want to go, and that would not work out; my mum found out I was slitting my wrist, which I feel awful about because she claims she is worried about me and that makes me see myself as an awful person for causing grief to her, and she told me that whenever I feel down I have to talk to her. But first of all, I do not feel comfortable talking to her about most of the roots of my feelings, and second of all, whenever I do, she does not do anything about it, she just tells me to cheer up or something, and generally just does not understand how I feel. So basicallly, if I asked my mum to take me to a professional, she would probably refuse to and tell me to tell her about my emotions. I am not going to ask my step dad because I hate him and he hates me. Moreover, I feel pretty crappy wanting to see a professional, as I know that most teens in the world probably feel the stuff I feel, and plus I do not even know if my feelings are a big deal. I might just be overreacting or attention seeking, I do not know. There are billions of people in the world, so my feelings do not have any worth, and there are millions of people who probably feel way worse. I do not think talking to an online person would help as they probably would not be able to provide a diagnosis, and plus I feel that they would understand more if we were in a room together. Plus I emailed childline about my problems and they did not really help.\\n\\nWhat could I do? Is there a way I could see a professional by myself, without anyone knowing? I want to debunk my insecurities, and I want someone to understand how I feel and explain things to me. \\n\\nAlso, I know the pandemic at the minute makes it impossible, I am talking about when it is over.“Life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,\\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a tale\\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\\nSignifying nothing.” \\n  Macbeth, act 5, scene 5. \\n\\nFor most of my life I have been struggling with depression, and tonight is the lowest I have felt in quite some time, because right now I feel as if nothing I do or say matters. \\n  \\n  Right now, I feel as if I am shouting into the void, and it refuses to hear me, which also explains how I feel about Reddit, Instagram, tumblr and any other social media site, as I post and post day after day and no one responds, no one cares. \\n\\n  I wish, that I could say something that no one could ignore, but it will never happen, due to the fact that I am nothing, a nobody, something that no one will ever care about.I feel like I do not matter to anyone. And if I left it would not really have an impact on them.\\n\\nI do not even think they like talking to me tbh. I think they sort of put up with me. I do not think they would be happy if I was gone, just that it would not have that great of an effect on them.\\n\\nI think my family would care, luckily. But to everyone else, they just would not.\\n\\nEdit: I am going through a really bad depressive episode. I was diagnosed late 2017 after the worst depression I had at that point. And I already know this is going to be worse. And I hate the fact that I am aware of my emotions, the effects it has on me, and the levels at which this depression hits me.I know this quarantine is absolutely horrible for a lot of people, so not everyone will agree with me on this. But...\\n\\nConfession; I am fucking loving being in lockdown. I think it is a really shitty situation and I am sorry that everyone the world over is being affected to negatively by this, but I am making the best out of it. I have only recently started working on my mental health and acknowledging my depression and anxiety since last December. This time to just focus on myself and be, with no responsibilities or family drama or struggling to get out of bed for people I do not want to work for while making no money and actually getting to spend time with my husband has been a major blessing for me. A week before lockdown I was discharged from the hospital for having a major depressive episode due to a new medication. I usually compare my depressive mood to being dark grey/going black, which is where I was before lockdown, and now I am a light/medium grey. I already know I am going to go back to black when it is over. it is going to be really hard to have to force myself to function all over again and knowing the same bullshit stressors that made me feel bad before are waiting for me is already bringing on the dark mood. it is not like I am getting salaried pay or anything, my unemployment is not going through and I am fighting with them for over three weeks now, so I am broke as shit. I am just appreciating the fact that my brain and body can take a break for the time being.My son is stuck in Ohio with my mom. I got out of the military and moved to N.C. for college. I got an apartment in February and the navy finally brought my stuff in March right before things started shutting down. Due to listing my house and waiting on furniture my son had to stay with my mom. My sons sperm donor can not have him for overnights until he does a drug rehab program. And i did not think it was fair for my son to be crashing between places while I waited for things to fall in place. \\nNow he is stuck in Ohio till this virus is over. My family was posting Easter pics. he is 2 now and last Easter he had so much fun getting eggs. it is the first holiday I have not been able to go up there and see him. I have been to depressed to finish unpacking. I lost my job but luckily I have benefits that I am able to use to pay my bills. But it is stressful. I just want my baby back, the sooner this virus ends the sooner he can come down. \\nLast week I reached out to the veterans crisis line and talked to someone through text. Lately I have been wishing I could just go to sleep till this blows over. I do not want to exist but I do not want to die. Also can not get into Veteran’s mental health till the end of May. I just want to talk to a specialist but I have to wait and it sucks. \\nOne of my friends is a specialist but I do not want to just use her since she has actual patients paying her. I did have a chat and she helped me realize my ptsd “diagnosis” (not confirmed my an actual mental health doc just my pcm) is actually cptsd. I was telling her the symptoms and she was able to guess it was my sons father that caused them. I feel like I am going through this alone. \\nI told my mom and family through Facebook messenger. My dad messaged my mom and said it was bullshit and I have had the ptsd symptoms since I was a kid. 🙄 but does not have the balls to actually message me about it. I havnt found a good time to talk to my boyfriend about it. He does not talk to my ex husband anymore but they use to be friends and it is weird. I want to talk to him soon but he is also been moody lately as well. he is been working more as a cyber security person from home than he has at work. \\nwe are all stressed.I have absolutely no desire to cut myself. Like 0% desire. But I hit/slap myself in the face often and have to hold myself back from hitting myself more (only my face, no desire to hit myself anywhere else). Like I just want to slam my face on a counter or through a mirror. I feel like I never hear about people hitting themselves as a symptom.I do not want to be suicidal anymore, I am so scared that one day my mom or my little brother are going to find me dead.  \\n\\n\\nI am just so scared, I can not take it anymore.Hi, I am not sure this is the right kind of post for the subreddit but here goes. My mom is depressed, she lost her job because of covid and is getting divorced from my father. it is an amicable divorce and she is financially very well off, but she is very worried about the future. Speaking with her she says she has no energy, she can barely bring herself to get up. I do not really know how to help her, me and my brother are doing house chores, I help paying the bills, but I do not feel I am giving the emotional support she needs. I offered to wake her up and exercise with her (this helped me a lot when I went through depression), any other ideas?My friends often tell me how they are going to \"fix\" me, and that I will get better. Strangely, I do not want that to happen. Depression has become so comforting.\\n\\nI feel like, like I do not any support no more. I want to be alone, really far away from civilisation, drink, drown in my stupid thoughts, and cry all night, and then die.\\n\\nAnyone here feeling the same way ?I know this sounds stupid, but I am having to change my life routines due to the fact that I can not bring myself to do stuff. Even the basics like bathing are becoming difficult for me. I have official paperwork to do that seems to have just disappeared into the ether. I am having a hard time eating, doing laundry and putting things away. Too anxious to walk outside. Nothing interests me. I have tried reading, I have tried using internet sites to be entertained, I have tried watching movies or tv to pass time. Talking to people is exhausting. It all just seems mindless and difficult. It feels defeating that everything feels this way. All I can bring myself to do is get through work. At this point I have considered that I hardly buy any food because it goes bad. I do not buy things that need to be cooked. I can not eat unless I am super hungry and once I eat a little then I just am not motivated to eat more. Food also makes a mess that then becomes a problem of cleaning up. The thing is it is all an excuse to be lazy so I convince myself to roll with the punches and just be ok with this and adapt to this because otherwise I would just be complaining. The company of others feels robotic. I feel like my conscience is going into illness and slowly withering away while my body tries to stay afloat. I know I will survive this but I do feel like a dirty pathetic human even though I know I am ambitious and have a lot to look forward to. I forget to drink water. I do not feel like drinking water.this might be a shit reason to get all worked up and stuff but like okay.\\n\\nme and my long time best friend who i would die for were playing minecraft. We got off and agreed to get back on at six, which would be two hours before we were going to invite two others to our world. \\n\\ni have not slept in a day or so and i was going to take a nap, but she said no bc we were going to get on at six. six cake around and she did not get on. i was pissed.\\n\\nshe then said at 8 that she never agreed to six and that she did not want to answer my messages. she could have at least gave me a heads up so i could have slept or not felt like shit bc she was ignoring me\\n\\nso at 8 i mention how she forgot ab me and she PISSED OFF and says how I am lying and how she never said 6 when we fucking agreed to it is making me all worked up and i want to cry and fucking slice me open bc she always does this.\\n\\nshe always says that she is right. She does not know it is so triggering to have to tell her that she is right all the time even tho she is not. i was right in this situation and she still made me say it was her so she would not get mad\\n\\nshe does it as a joke sometimes which is semi okay, but when she is serious is makes me want to fucking cry. When she is in a bitch mood she is in a bitch mood and i can not even talk to her at that point bc i can not deal with it.\\n\\nand yeah, it is triggering to be told your wrong all the time. \\n\\nbut at the same time i wish i could tell her about this and everything but I am afraid she would just say something that would make me upset ig. \\n\\ni do not know at this point \\n\\nidk what this post is either too..I am not alive for myself. I am alive for everyone around me. for my friends and my family. i do not care about myself. i love every day hoping it could be my last. i relapsed again and I am not proud but it happened and i do not know what to do about it. I am so tired of everything and being hurt.I think love is a cycle - and it happens every single time. I am still young, just a measly 22 years old. However, I feel like i have experienced much more than others when it comes to this...\\n\\nIt always begins the same.. infatuation, butterflies in the stomach, staring at your phone waiting for that message or call.\\n\\nThat is my favorite stage, without a doubt.\\n\\nI get so involved in this stage, at times I wish I could just hit a pause button to have more time to appreciate the beginning of a relationship. In retrospect, I feel like I always move too fast, and that is where the problem arises.\\n\\nThen you get to the relationship, and things are amazing. You begin to be together more, start declaring your feelings for the person as much as you can, the feelings of wanting to be with this person every minute of the day just keeps getting stronger.\\n\\nUntil something happens, usually something negative that happens to me, like a depressive effect or an instance of anxiety. And that is when the beginning of the end happens. When you show them that you are a human like everyone else, with real life problems.\\n\\nAnd one day their tone is different, they do not sound the same as they used to, and slowly it progresses. Until you receive a text saying that its just not going to work out.\\n\\nIts a cycle, a cycle that I am tired of being a part ofI was in a shitty relationship last year with someone  that was on and off with me a couple of years before. I do not know why I was even in a relationship with him again in the first place after all the different times he left me for someone else. I guess it is because people like him find insecure people like me and just plant themselves in our heads. \\nI have worked at the same place for over three years and over time got to know a guy there. I never (tried) to think anything of him to begin with, but I think people knew I felt something for him anyways. I am not very good at hiding my bashfulness. He seemed to be everything I wanted out of a person.\\nThings were not going well in the relationship I was in. I was duped yet again, he was not going to change. He said he got a coworker\\'s number just to see if he still had game, quit the job I got him, constantly belittled me in his \"subtle\" ways. I was fully convinced I was going to commit to breaking up with him. I wanted to talk to the coworker so badly that night, and my alcoholism helped out with that. Called him, told him how I felt and that I was going to dump the ex the next morning. \\nBut I did not. that is most definitely where the conversation began but he threw a tantrum and \"tried\" leaving without his stuff. In hindsight I see I was being manipulated but when I tried to calm him down and he started bawling about how he wanted to marry me, I felt horrible and like I was about to throw away everything for someone I have never been with. Who might just leave me high and dry after a hookup. I let my insecurities be fed and stayed with ex for a little konger. I told my coworker after work the next day.... he did not seem upset, he gave me a hug and told me he understood. But then he seemed.... different. \\nI broke up with ex for good after I found out something disgusting he said to my sister and how he stole another sister\\'s ear pods. Hurting my sisters drew the line for me.\\nAnd I went to the coworker, he just wanted to stay friends and he would hang out with me and my friends for the next few months occassionally. A few months ago we were still texting sometimes and joking around. But, knowing I hurt him still haunts me. I have never done anything like that before and it was the shittiest thing I would ever done to the person I did not know I was going to hurt. I still cry about it and feel selfish for hoping he will forgive me someday and want to try again. I try to escape thinking about him but I can not. I have got other shit going on in my life too but this feels like the biggest weight.I am a 17 yr old male living under a mother who verbally and physically abuses me (I was diagnosed with depression earlier this year, and take Lexapro for it). Nothing insane that leaves scars or bruises, but she is constantly calling me retarded, slow, weak, and pushes me around. When I try to call people, my father, or the police, she says she will pull me from my school and that my life will be over- she also threatens to kick me out of the house. For context- I cannot go live with my father, I am stuck with her and I do not know what to do. I have contemplated suicide multiple times, and when I told her she told me to \"do it\". She has refused to give me dinner and I do not know what to do- she has cut off my credit card and locked me in my room- it is because I asked her why she stole money from my father\\'s child support (which she uses for herself, and not me or my little brother) and did not put it into a trust for us. Please, if you are out there- help me.I told my crush that I liked her and she told me she did not have the capacity to feel anything for anyone at the moment, the next week I heard from a mutual friend that she is on a date with someone else. Then we (the crush and I) met up with some friend to go downtown and she was there with her date and they were doing pda in front of me and she acted as if she was oblivious to what she told me about her not being able to have feelings for anyone. Do I have the right to feel sad? because I feel like I am over reacting. I am not sad about her having a date, I am sad about her lying to me because we are friends after all and friends are supposed to be honest with each other, right?I do not what to do. I feel like I lost myself, like I am not myself anymore. I find myself wanting to go home but I am here, standing my house surrounded by my family yet I want to leave and run. \\n\\nRun anywhere, they are good people, but I just can not stand it anymore. Like I do not want to stay home. I do all my hobbies on the little free time I have from my stupid online classes. But I just can not feel that spark of pleasure anymore. \\n\\nI go outside feed the neighborhood cats, yet I have just become numb to all life. I envy them sometimes because at least they can feel something unlike me. I just feel like failure, a fake undeserving person. I help people so I can try to be a good person. I feel so selfish for being sad. I have everything I could ever need, but I am not happy I feel like a body with nothing inside but a pile of shit with a decent face.\\n\\nI just slap a stupid smile and try to enjoy life but I just can not. I do not want to lie anymore. I want to scream for help from my family, but I just can not they stressed enough. I have tired therapy and self harm neither were able to please my pain. I ask of you reading this to please give me some hope please. \\n\\nSo I can leave this horrible mental prison. I want to be happy with my family, my love ones,and my friends. I need someone to help me. I do not want be a bother anymore. I do not want to be sad anymore please just help me.Sorry for bad English. My past is full of bad memories, traumas and times when ı was humiliated. No matter how much ı do not want to remember, it comes to my mind and instantly lower my hapinnes in everywhere and ı feel like shit. It brings the feel that if ı\\'m ever going to be happy person. I am so fucking tired of it.She said she broke up and she did not care about him, and me being the supportive one, says that I do not want to be in a relationship and just stick with just friends. I immediately regretted saying that and feel more down than I ever did before.I have depression, and the whole quarantine thing has made it really come out, but I have been spending a lot of time talking to friends on Discord. I say and post a lot of stupid things, and I am no good at any of the games we play together, but they always welcome me. they are the best thing that is happened to me in a long time. I think one guy, Rico, notices when I am feeling off. He asks if I am doing alright but I just give some vague answer. he is married with two young kids and I really do not want to drag him down into anything.\\n\\nI am one of the newer members of the server, and the guys who have been friends for awhile like to hang out with each other mostly. In addition, most of them are admins and moderators for the server. So, one day I was hanging out by myself in a voice channel when Rico pulls me into a hidden chat so I would not be alone. One other guy, who is not a mod, complained. He said I was cool, but not enough for the \"circle of trust\". Rico told him to screw off politely.\\n\\nit is such a small thing, and I feel like I am overreacting, but it really hurt. I always wondered why I would spend a couple of hours in chat by myself before logging off, then a few minutes later a full squad is in chat playing together. I am probably being paranoid, but I feel like some of them are avoiding me. Rico says they are not, but he is also the only one who will join me in a channel when I am by myself, except for a couple of the newer guys. It feels like there is a clique of friends that the newbies are not allowed into unless they are with a chaperon, and I hate it.\\n\\nI want to leave and just let them forget about me, but I do not want to abandon the two or three that I consider to be friends. On the other hand, I do not want to be a burden on Rico that he feels like he has to babysit me all the time. What should I do?So I am writing this while I am waiting on my plug to pull up. So I am very depressed and it is been this way for years you would think after dealing with my depression for years I would be able to start handling it better but that is not the case. there is not really anything that can help me even when I smoke sometimes the bad thoughts come in. I just wish I are not have to smoke to be some what happy because like right now I have been sober for a day and the thoughts are so bad they feel like they actually hurt physically even in a good moment my thoughts will creep up on me. I just want to die I hope I catch the corona and welp just die. I just feel like death is the only answer I am starting to think there is nothing else that would helpPart 3: parent pressure \\nLike in all my previous posts I have mentioned or linked to parents and how when going through depression and describing how it is my depression worse \\n\\nSo majority of the time even if it is for the tiniest of things I get shouted at and get called and idiot because I am doing it wrong \\' or that I am annoying my parent has a tendency to swear or smoke around me which makes me feel insecure especially when I have two younger siblings living under the same roof and it most likely affects them to \\n\\nFurthermore sometimes when I get shouted it is really aggressive and contains some threats because of the because of my depression not having my biological dad around so I never played catch he was not there when I learnt how to ride a back or see me start high school or primary (elementary and middle school for you Americans out there )\\n\\nMoving on when ever I speak I have a large amount of sincerity behind my vocals where as when I get shouted at there is large amounts of aggression behind it also I have trouble speaking good grammar most of this post is actually automatically correct of completed by my phone:p so I have that running for me \\n\\nHeading back to the because of my depression my biological father being the because of it is always adding to my depression as it is as I recall I can message him when I am ready and so when I do not reply I get shouted at which keeps adding to the pile of depression which makes me feel like trash and human filth and that I do not belong on this earth \\n\\nBeing a 15 yr old white 2/3 english male and 1/3 danish (if I am correct) makes it worse because my body has not finished growing same for my mind because your mind is actually the most fragile part of your body or conscious if you want to be scientific \\n\\nSo I want dilly dally much longer this is Everwild signing out (•~•)/I am going to kill myself eventually, I feel I am destined for it. I guess all I can do now is occupy the time before I snap, and I was going to do that by pursuing psychology which is the only subject I am remotely interested in. But to get anywhere I will need a whole PhD, and when I get there what am I going to do? Lie to people like me who realize medicine and therapy do not work for everyone and tell them it will get better if they keep trying? Why should I even bother getting all that education when I will just get in debt and kill myself anyway? Why should I work at a firm that is just going to suck 45 dollars from strugglong patients just to see *me* every session? Why should I be pretending to help people to make myself feel like I am maybe not a waste of space for 20 minutes? How much incorrect advice will I give? How many of my patients will kill themselves because I failed? I love psychology. I want to help people so bad. I just realistically think it will not make any difference or be worth it. For every patient I help, that\\'ll get erased by the 1 I fail to help. This is the wrong attitude for this field, I know, but I am too lazy and stupid to do anything else- this is already a step down from a harder degree I was going to pursue. I wish I would just die in a car accident and not have to do anything ever again.Hi, I have struggled with low motivation and depression since I have left school after moving away from friends etc, but I dealt with It by powerlifting and loved the gym and it completely changed how I thought about myself and basically turned my life around but since this lockdown I am struggling to get out of bed and have thought multiple times about overdosing on xanax and alcohol is there anyone who has any tips on something to get me by until this is all over?I have no motivation to get any work done, I am finishing my junior year of college and I want to finalize this semester strong as I am a straight A student, but I am so depressed being trapped home due to COVID-19 ever since my college closed down to remote classes for the semester. I have never been so depressed where I am sitting unable to focus or do anything for days, I just sit in my room and try to study and work, but I space out not even procrastinating truly just doing nothing. And all I feel is even more guilty because I feel like I am letting my professors and myself down by being unable to do my work. I feel myself loosing track of contacting my best friend from school, and I feel like I am becoming fully isolated at home, which in itself is already difficult given the circumstances. Now I am back in my toxic home environment having to deal with a past abuser who I cannot communicate with. I went a month walking on eggshells before anything became instigated between us in an interaction, but today I finally snapped and broke down. Now I can not even leave my room to go to the kitchen or anything and I have been trying to force myself to sit and work and all I want to do is die.\\n\\nI have never really been at this intense of a low before where I am spending days on end starring at a wall or zoning out and disassociating all day. I feel suicidal, and now with all that is happening in the world the short and long term future goals that were propelling me forward through my bad days do not exist because it is all unknown. On top of all this, I have been having extremely vivid nightmares which has not really been something I have experienced a lot before nearly every night I guess because I am in this perpetual state of anxiety and stress. I feel like I can not  just have a single moment of peace to breathe and not feel like absolute shit.I can not get out of bed and I am behind 1 month on all my assignments. I can not focus or concentrate on anything. I am just too sad and regretful to care about what is going on with my school work. I never let my grades drop before but now I have Cs. Any tips??Let me preface this by saying that I am currently in high school and my mental health has been really awful ever since I went to my new school. A lot of it has to do with grades since my elementary school was rather easy and I never really faced any difficulty. \\n\\nI feel like I am a massive disappointment to everyone especially my parents. My grades are really bad and they are declining more and more, and although my parents say it is okay, I feel like they do not really mean it and I let them down. In addition, I also feel like I also waste a lot of their time and money. I have picked up and lost interest in so many extracurriculars and sports over the years, and even though I want to say I do try my hardest when it comes to everything, I know deep down that I am not doing enough and I am just too lazy and lack motivation to work hard and accomplish my goals.\\n\\nOnline learning has been especially difficult on me since I made it my goal this semester to have all As. However, online learning barely improves my grades at all and I feel fucking terrible that I did not do something about this before when I had the time to (like several years ago). I would like to tell myself that it is alright, I will learn from this experience and I will try harder next year, but I know deep down that I am just making excuses to cope with the truth.\\n\\nAs for my friends, most of them are nice but I do not feel comfortable venting to them like this since they will judge me. they will tell me things like \"it will be okay!!\" though I feel it is not as sincere since it is much easier for them to say that when they are not going through the same. My teachers do not really care a lot even though they do try to act like it and often times I feel alone with nobody to turn to. I would love to have a cat or dog but I can not due to my current living situation. \\n\\nAny advice? I have been in tears for the past few hours because I can not fix my grades. People like to tell me that a single number does not define me as a person but it will definitely impact my future.my mom and step-dad are very ‘opposed’ to mental health issues, especially my step-dad, who openly states that people will depression need ‘to get over it’ and it is all attention seeking (might also add that his son tried to kill himself a couple of years ago, and so I honestly HOPE that my step-dad is just in denial). I have been struggling on and off for 5 years, the past 8 months being the worst it is been since I began to struggle with depression. \\n\\nI feel absolutely fucking pathetic. I can not even begin to describe how much self-loathing I feel at even the thought of how I feel. I hate expressing emotions and find it really hard to open up to my boyfriend for this reason. I can never seem to describe how I feel without feeling gross and I believe this is down to how my parents would react if they found out about how I have been struggling.\\n\\nI have been doing online therapy for the past 3 months and it is honestly barely helped because I can not bring myself to use it regularly or use the helping tools. My parents are not aware of this - although I have hinted that I do therapy to my mom but she does not often pay interest. I am at a point now where I do not even want to help myself to stop the negative impact I have on those around me - it is beyond selfish, and I am beyond caring. \\n\\nHow I have felt has ruined my relationships with almost everyone in my life and I do not know how to come back. I am scared about how I am going to ruin mine and other people’s lives in the long-term. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like a burden on myself and everything I do is just exhausting. I am so tired.\\n\\napologies for the vent. I am done now, and will most likely sheepishly delete this tomorrow.:)I just will not be able to last much longer the way I am. I am just soooo fucking tired of myself. I am unable to vent my negative emotions, so I just let them devour me. I am the guy you go to when your world is falling apart and I will do everything I can to fix it, but I just can not fix my own world. My friends are trying to help me the same way I helped them, but I for some reason do not trust them. I know, that they are 100% trustworthy and I jad lots of \"deep\" moments with them, but I just can not get myself to trust them, so I can not get them to help me properly. Maybe it is because I do not know what the main problem is.\\nI would like to work out and build up some of my muscles, but because I do not see result I just give up on it even tho I know that if I keep going the results will start to pop up. I do not have any life goals expect get a family. I am missing love in my life, but it is because when I am near a girl I just start panicking. I did not have this problem when I was younger, but I do now... Why?\\n\\nI hate who I am, but I love myself for who I am. I would love to be more assertive and not be the all out funny guy. But even when I am trying I just can not change.\\n\\nThe trust issues I have are killing me, as I do not trust anyone. I do not trust my best friends who tell me all sort of things, from their very shameful stories to their failed pick up attempts. But I still do not trust them. I do not trust my family and I do not fucking know why.\\n\\nI am all about not giving up, but I still give up on myself. \\n\\nI feel like I am missing something in life, but I have no idea what it is.. Is it love? Is it some adrenaline? I just do not know.\\nI have shit loads of other problems, but the post would be very long.\\n\\nIn all honesty I just do not know anymore. I was trying to help people in this subreddit, but I can not even help myself.\\n\\nIf you read the whole thing than damn.. Thank you, but i do not really think that you can help. I am really just trying to vent myself and see if I can figure out my next step in life.Once it is all over, you are just left with the same empty feeling you started with. On to the next person, right? No, I can not keep doing this to myself.[removed]Some thoughts,\\n\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/NtXwN8aI was very anxious about going to seek help, starting and telling anyone about my situation. Cheers to this journey. I wish you all the endless feeling of unconditional love, the warmth of the sun, and a strong heart.I do not really know what to do with my life and I am just a teenager, I am constantly sad and I have family issues. I have gotten into fistfights with my dad as he sometimes gets very aggressive when I play video games and such, he constantly calls me useless, idiot, stupid, pussy, etc. He hates my interests (which are video games and technology) calling them useless pastimes. I have tried to talk about these problems with my mom but she often just tells me they do not matter and I will “walk them off”. \\n\\nThis has lead me into the point of not knowing weather my problems are important or not, I am middle class so I definitely know some people have it worse than me. That is why feeling bad about my problems feels stupid to me, and I know I should be happy for what I have got, yet I have not been happy for a long time. I usually wonder if I am depressed or if I am just a teenager with sad “episodes”. I can not seem to find the answer, this is why I come to this subreddit \\n\\nI have the best grades in my school and I take pride on how quickly I learn, I happily bring my A’s to my dad seeking for some form of recognition but I do not get it, he tells me it is my obligation. I want to make games for a living but now I do not know if my parents will even support my career choice. \\n\\nThank in advance for your comments and support. (Sorry if my English is not that good, my first language is Spanish)Background: I have been clinically depressed, have been diagnosed with social anxiety and have had suicidal ideation since I started college. I started taking prozac and I was on it for about three year before I stopped because I thought I was much better and did not need it anymore. Unfortunately, the decision to do that was around the same time I decided to start going out and drinking alcohol (8 months ago), which proved to be the worst decision of my life. \\n\\nI had a crush on one of my friends for 2 years. I have been called ugly by people, including close friends(jokingly, but it still hurts), never had a girlfriend and have overall been subconscious about my appearance during my 21 years of life. Because of all that I did not have any confidence in myself. I kept my feelings for her to myself for a year and a half.  I finally decided to tell her how I feel and she said she was not looking for anything right now and she would rather remain friends. I was okay with that but I noticed that she became more distant and a couple times I got drunk and drunk texted my feelings -- things I should never say that ended up jeopardizing our friendship. Through that we remain friends until three months ago I drunk texted her again and as a result she blocked me on every social media platform with no explanation. The thought of losing her completely kicked in and I was trying to force a reconciliation by messaging her friends, just trying to explain myself and not lose her because I really did cherished her as a friend. I mentioned hurting myself and not wanting to live. Two days later, I saw her on campus (its a small university), and I tried to talk to her, but she ran away from me and called campus PD, which led to me getting baker acted. \\n\\nMy crush had always told me how much she loves and cares about me as a friend, how we would always be friends no matter and how great of a person I am. So never in a million years would I think we would stop being friends. People always tell me that I am the nicest, most thoughtful and caring person they know, but everyday I wake up and feel like I am the worst person in the world. It has really been eating me up on the inside. I lost a friend because of the mistakes I made. I have NEVER LOST A FRIEND BEFORE THIS. The same week of the incident, a couple mutual friends came up to me regarding the messages, which triggered my anxiety to a whole new level. I felt betrayed that the private messages I sent while intoxicated were exposed and now god knows how many people know about them. I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped going out, deleted social media and have isolated myself and I do not plan on going back. My anxiety has skyrocketed and I just have been avoiding everyone. (all of this was months before the pandemic).\\n\\nI know everything I did is inexcusable and I guess this is a way of punishing myself for it. The suicidal ideation remain. I am embarrassed. I am regretful. I am remorseful. Even if she forgives in the future, I   would not want her to see me again. I just want everyone to forget I exist and disappear.I feel like a Loser like Beck says. Anyone else feeling like that way right now?I do not want to sleep because that means the day is over. Another day wasted. Another day filled with missed opportunities. All the time in the world and doing nothing with it. it is just an endless cycle of not wanting to do anything and hating the fact that I never do anything. When I wake up tomorrow, my first feeling will be anger. Anger towards myself for not having used the previous day in a way that is productive, and anger over the realization that this day will end the same way. It always ends like this. With boredom, anger and self-loathing. it is not fun, it is not interesting, and it is not helpful to anyone. It just sucks.Found out that the girl who recently broke my heart has moved on after 3 weeks. Feel like I was just  a stepping stone for her to be happier, and more confident in herself. Just feel worthless after I tried giving her my everything and she just ended things so quickly and moved on like it was nothing. I am on the verge of quitting my job because I have been working 18 hour shifts for weeks, and I do not see any end in sight.I ever since a couple of years ago have gotten depressed every single time i have had time of school. As an example, we had this week of for easter and my mental health was not that good to begin with but it got double as bad now.\\n\\nEvery single day is a progressive cycle of depression, i wake up ok but it gets worse during the day until i go to bed which will be at the worst its at (I am at that point right now) and the cycle repeats.I am a dude in my early 30s. Have bachelor and master degrees. Have overcome a lot of mental health problems in my life, though depression still plagues me. \\n\\nI have been trying to climb the socioeconomic ladder and break into a career that I actually care about (healthcare, specifically mental healthcare). Was suddenly laid off last month because the market tanked and COVID-19 spread.\\n\\nI have lived somewhat frugally, though much to my self-imposed embarrassment. Like, I am still renting a shitty apartment in a low-income-high-crime area of town. Most of my friends have single-family homes/houses/condos. \\n\\nI have tried to pivot and learn computer programming (Python and Java), but I do not have the aptitude for it. \\n\\nI do not know, I just feel like that by now at my age, things would not be so difficult, that I would be struggling so much still (financially and career), and that I would have *something* to show for the effort I have put into life. \\n\\nI am so fucking tired of struggling and failing and being at the whims of a system that is inherently stacked against the common working person. I feel like I am being punished but have no clue as to what I did wrong.\\n\\nJust let me off this shit ride.I have suffered from depression for a long time. Me and my wife are separating, and then the coronavirus happened. We decided to get back together, but it is been seven days now and we got into a horrible fight and are separate again. I am drinking again and the fights are horrible. I feel low real low. And I feel horrible. I can not control myself and I hurt her when i do not want to. I am sorry if this is the wrong place, but I do not feel my best. I have a video chat with my therapist tomorrow, but I have not felt good. Not in a long time. I can barely work or focus on anything, and I latch onto anything to do that will make me feel better. I even spent 200 dollars on a charcuterie board during one of my moods the other day. I do not know why, because it gave me something to do. I do not want anyone to talk to. I do not even know what I would say. I just want to vent. Like I said I am sorry if this is the wrong place. But I do not feel good right now.i really hate myself like really really hate myself. i wish i could kill myself but i can not because I am the most spineless person alive. i hate myselfWhy the fuck not me? Come right at me, bro!'"
